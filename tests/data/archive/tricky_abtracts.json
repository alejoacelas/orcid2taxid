    "title": "Computational prediction of the effect of mutations in the receptor-binding domain on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2",
    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 continues to mutate. Numerous studies have indicated that this viral mutation, particularly in the receptor-binding domain area, may increase the viral affinity for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor for viral entry into host cells, thereby increasing viral virulence and transmission. In this study, we investigated the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants (Delta plus, Iota, Kappa, Mu, Lambda, and C.1.2) on hACE2 using computational modeling with a protein–protein docking approach. The simulation results indicated that there were differences in the interactions between the RBD and hACE2, including hydrogen bonding, salt bridge interactions, non-bonded interactions, and binding free energy differences among these variants. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that mutations in the RBD increase the stability of the hACE2-spike protein complex relative to the wild type, following the global stability trend and increasing the binding affinity. The value of binding-free energy calculated using molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) indicated that all mutations in the spike protein increased the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The findings of this study provide a foundation for developing effective interventions against these variants.",

    "title": "Identification of a Novel Coronavirus in Bats",
    "abstract": "Exotic wildlife can act as reservoirs of diseases that are endemic in the area or can be the source of new emerging diseases through interspecies transmission. The recent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) highlights the importance of virus surveillance in wild animals. Here, we report the identification of a novel bat coronavirus through surveillance of coronaviruses in wildlife. Analyses of the RNA sequence from the ORF1b and S-gene regions indicated that the virus is a group 1 coronavirus. The virus was detected in fecal and respiratory samples from three bat species (Miniopterus spp.). In particular, 63% (12 of 19) of fecal samples from Miniopterus pusillus were positive for the virus. These findings suggest that this virus might be commonly circulating in M. pusillus in Hong Kong.",

    "title": "Genetic diversity of Nipah virus in Bangladesh",
    "abstract": "Background\nNipah virus (NiV) infection, often fatal in humans, is primarily transmitted in Bangladesh through the consumption of date palm sap contaminated by Pteropus bats. Person-to-person transmission is also common and increases the concern of large outbreaks. This study aimed to characterize the molecular epidemiology, phylogenetic relationship, and the evolution of the nucleocapsid gene (N gene) of NiV.\nMethods\nWe conducted molecular detection, genetic characterization, and Bayesian time-scale evolution analyses of NiV using pooled Pteropid bat roost urine samples from an outbreak area in 2012 and archived RNA samples from NiV case patients identified during 2012–2018 in Bangladesh.\nResults\nNiV-RNA was detected in 19% (38/456) of bat roost urine samples and among them, nine N gene sequences were recovered. We also retrieved sequences from 53% (21 out of 39) of archived RNA samples from patients. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Bangladeshi strains belonged to NiV-BD genotype and had an evolutionary rate of 4.64 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year. The analyses suggested that the strains of NiV-BD genotype diverged during 1995 and formed two sublineages.\nConclusion\nThis analysis provides further evidence that the NiV strains of the Malaysian and Bangladesh genotypes diverged recently and continue to evolve. More extensive surveillance of NiV in bats and human will be helpful to explore strain diversity and virulence potential to infect humans through direct or person-to-person virus transmission.",

    "title": "Characterization of Marburg virus glycoprotein in viral entry",
    "abstract": "One major determinant of host tropism for filoviruses is viral glycoprotein (GP), which is involved in receptor binding and viral entry. Compared to Ebola GP (EGP), Marburg GP (MGP) is less well characterized in viral entry. In this study, using a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudotyped virus as a surrogate system, we have characterized the role of MGP in viral entry. We have shown that like EGP, the mucin-like region of MGP (289–501) is not essential for virus entry. We have developed a viral entry interference assay for filoviruses, and using this assay, we have demonstrated that transfection of EGP or MGP in target cells can interfere with EGP/HIV and MGP/HIV pseudotyped virus entry in a dose-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the notion that Ebola and Marburg viruses use the same or a related host molecule(s) for viral entry. Substitutions of the non-conserved residues in MGP1 did not impair MGP-mediated viral entry. Unlike that of EGP1, individual substitutions of many conserved residues of MGP1 exerted severe defects in MGP expression, incorporation to HIV virions, and thus its ability to mediate viral entry. These results indicate that MGP is more sensitive to substitutions of the conserved residues, suggesting that MGP may fold differently from EGP.",

    "title": "Exploring the key genomic variation in monkeypox virus during the 2022 outbreak",
    "abstract": "Background\nIn 2022, a global outbreak of monkeypox occurred with a significant shift in its epidemiological characteristics. The monkeypox virus (MPXV) belongs to the B.1 lineage, and its genomic variations that were linked to the outbreak were investigated in this study. Previous studies have suggested that viral genomic variation plays a crucial role in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of viruses. Therefore, understanding the genomic variation of MPXV is crucial for controlling future outbreaks.\nMethods\nThis study employed bioinformatics and phylogenetic approaches to evaluate the key genomic variation in the B.1 lineage of MPXV. A total of 979 MPXV strains were screened, and 212 representative strains were analyzed to identify specific substitutions in the viral genome. Reference sequences were constructed for each of the 10 lineages based on the most common nucleotide at each site. A total of 49 substitutions were identified, with 23 non-synonymous substitutions. Class I variants, which had significant effects on protein conformation likely to affect viral characteristics, were classified among the non-synonymous substitutions.\nResults\nThe phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 relatively monophyletic branches. The study identified 49 substitutions specific to the B.1 lineage, with 23 non-synonymous substitutions that were classified into Class I, II, and III variants. The Class I variants were likely responsible for the observed changes in the characteristics of circulating MPXV in 2022. These key mutations, particularly Class I variants, played a crucial role in the pathogenicity and transmissibility of MPXV.\nConclusion\nThis study provides an understanding of the genomic variation of MPXV in the B.1 lineage linked to the recent outbreak of monkeypox. The identification of key mutations, particularly Class I variants, sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed changes in the characteristics of circulating MPXV. Further studies can focus on functional domains affected by these mutations, enabling the development of effective control strategies against future monkeypox outbreaks.",

    "title": "An Outbred Guinea Pig Disease Model for Lassa Fever Using a Host-Adapted Clade III Nigerian Lassa Virus",
    "abstract": "Nigeria experiences annual outbreaks of Lassa fever (LF) with high case numbers. At least three clades of Lassa virus (LASV) have been documented in Nigeria, though recent outbreaks are most often associated with clade II or clade III viruses. Using a recently isolated clade III LASV from a case of LF in Nigeria in 2018, we developed and characterized a guinea pig adapted virus capable of causing lethal disease in commercially available Hartley guinea pigs. Uniform lethality was observed after four passages of the virus and was associated with only two dominant genomic changes. The adapted virus was highly virulent with a median lethal dose of 10 median tissue culture infectious doses. Disease was characterized by several hallmarks of LF in similar models including high fever, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, and increased inflammatory immune mediators. High viral loads were noted in all solid organ specimens analyzed. Histological abnormalities were most striking in the lungs and livers of terminal animals and included interstitial inflammation, edema, and steatosis. Overall, this model represents a convenient small animal model for a clade III Nigeria LASV with which evaluation of specific prophylactic vaccines and medical countermeasures can be conducted.",

    "title": "Genetic and Anatomic Determinants of Enzootic Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus Infection of Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus",
    "abstract": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) is a re-emerging, mosquito-borne viral disease with the potential to cause fatal encephalitis in both humans and equids. Recently, detection of endemic VEE caused by enzootic strains has escalated in Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Ecuador, emphasizing the importance of understanding the enzootic transmission cycle of the etiologic agent, VEE virus (VEEV). The majority of work examining the viral determinants of vector infection has been performed in the epizootic mosquito vector, Aedes (Ochlerotatus) taeniorhynchus. Based on the fundamental differences between the epizootic and enzootic cycles, we hypothesized that the virus-vector interaction of the enzootic cycle is fundamentally different from that of the epizootic model. We therefore examined the determinants for VEEV IE infection in the enzootic vector, Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus, and determined the number and susceptibility of midgut epithelial cells initially infected and their distribution compared to the epizootic virus-vector interaction. Using chimeric viruses, we demonstrated that the determinants of infection for the enzootic vector are different than those observed for the epizootic vector. Similarly, we showed that, unlike A. taeniorhynchus infection with subtype IC VEEV, C. taeniopus does not have a limited subpopulation of midgut cells susceptible to subtype IE VEEV. These findings support the hypothesis that the enzootic VEEV relationship with C. taeniopus differs from the epizootic virus-vector interaction in that the determinants appear to be found in both the nonstructural and structural regions, and initial midgut infection is not limited to a small population of susceptible cells.",

    "title": "Neutralization of antibody-enhanced dengue infection by VIS513, a pan serotype reactive monoclonal antibody targeting domain III of the dengue E protein",
    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) infection imposes enormous health and economic burden worldwide with no approved treatment. Several small molecules, including lovastatin, celgosivir, balapiravir, and chloroquine have been tested for potential anti-dengue activity in clinical trials; none of these have demonstrated a protective effect. Recently, based on identification and characterization of cross-serotype neutralizing antibodies, there is increasing attention on the potential for dengue immunotherapy. Here, we tested the ability of VIS513, an engineered cross-neutralizing humanized antibody targeting the DENV E protein domain III, to overcome antibody-enhanced infection and high but brief viremia, which are commonly encountered in dengue patients, in various in vitro and in vivo models. We observed that VIS513 efficiently neutralizes DENV at clinically relevant viral loads or in the presence of enhancing levels of DENV immune sera. Single therapeutic administration of VIS513 in mouse models of primary infection or lethal secondary antibody-enhanced infection, reduces DENV titers and protects from lethal infection. Finally, VIS513 administration does not readily lead to resistance, either in cell culture systems or in animal models of dengue infection. The findings suggest that rapid viral reduction during acute DENV infection with a monoclonal antibody is feasible.",

    "title": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived glial cells and neural progenitors display divergent responses to Zika and dengue infections",
    "abstract": "Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is recognized as the cause of an epidemic of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies in human fetuses. It remains unclear how ZIKV accesses the highly vulnerable population of neural progenitors of the fetal central nervous system (CNS), and which cell types of the CNS may be viral reservoirs. In contrast, the related dengue virus (DENV) does not elicit teratogenicity. To model viral interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV and DENV for different induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cells, with a particular focus on microglia-like cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors, astrocytes, and microglia-like cells (pMGLs), but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors. Infected glial cells propagated ZIKV and maintained ZIKV load over time, leading to viral spread to susceptible cells. DENV triggered stronger immune responses and could be cleared by neural and glial cells more efficiently. pMGLs, when cocultured with neural spheroids, invaded the tissue and, when infected with ZIKV, initiated neural infection. Since microglia derive from primitive macrophages originating in proximity to the maternal vasculature, they may act as a viral reservoir for ZIKV and establish infection of the fetal brain. Infection of immature neural stem cells by invading microglia may occur in the early stages of pregnancy, before angiogenesis in the brain rudiments. Our data are also consistent with ZIKV and DENV affecting the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, thus allowing infection of the brain later in life.",
