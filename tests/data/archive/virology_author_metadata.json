      "biography": "My researches have been focusing on the fundamental investigation of parvoviruses, including infection, viral-host interaction and pathogenicity mechanism. The main scientific contributions including identification of AXL as a co-receptor for B19V infection of human erythroid progenitors, the identification of key viral proteins’ functions during human parvovirus B19 (B19V) entry, the establishment of a high-throughput screening platform for B19V and the screening of antiviral compounds, the elucidation of the replication mechanisms of Adeno-associated virus (AAV), mapping of the replication initiation complex and essential proteins in Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) replication center, and identification of the causative agent of short beak and dwarfism syndrome in Pekin ducks and elucidation of its epidemiology and pathogenic mechanism. These findings have expanded the understanding of parvoviruses infection and pathogenicity mechanism and provided scientific information for parvoviruses control and optimization of manufacturing processes of gene therapy products.\n\n(I-A) Identification of viral and host protein interaction of B19V.\t\nBased on the endonuclease activity of B19V NS1 protein, I established a high-throughput screening platform for B19V and identified four leading antiviral compounds (Journal of Virology, 2021). I demonstrated the N-terminal domain of B19V VP1 enters human erythroid progenitors and inhibits B19 infection (Journal of Virology, 2021). I identified host protein AXL as a co-receptor for B19V infection of human erythroid progenitors (Science Advances, 2023).\n\n(I-B) Dissection of HBoV1 replication initiation complex.\nCombine with the established in vitro replication platform, I dissected the formation of HBoV1 replication initiation complex, which revealed the interaction of viral NS1 (Journal of Virology, 2022) and NP1 proteins with host proteins Ku complex, RPA complex (PLoS Pathogens, 2022), and CPSF6 (Journal of Virology, 2020). Besides, I helped to demonstrate that hairpin transfer-independent parvovirus DNA replication produces infectious virus, which is highlighted by editor (Journal of Virology, 2021).\n\n(I-C) Function of DNA damage response in AAV and recombinant AAV (rAAV).\nI reported the role of induced DDR in AAV replication and rAAV transduction (mBio, 2023). I found that inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit boosts rAAV transduction of polarized human airway epithelium (Molecular therapy. Methods & clinical development, 2023). These results have broadened the understanding of DDR in AAV replication and rAAV transduction. \n\n(I-D) investigation on goose parvovirus (GPV) and discovery of waterfowl associated virus.\nMy research revealed the genetic detection, characterization, and pathogenicity of GPV, which is the causative agent of short beak and dwarfism syndrome of Pekin ducks. I demonstrated the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this Pekin duck-origin GPV in goose embryos, goslings (Avian Pathology, 2018), and Cherry Valley Pekin ducks (Veterinary Microbiology, 2017; Infection, Genetics and Evolution, 2017), which benefits the duck industry. Besides, I helped to explore the genetic characterization of various novel viruses, e.g., astrovirus (Archives of Virology, 2018), megriviruses (Journal of General Virology, 2017), reovirus (Virus Research, 2016), and picornavirus (Journal of General Virology, 2014) in waterfowl. I participated in the generation of a reliable full-length cDNA of infectious Tembusu virus by using a PCR-based protocol (Virus Research, 2016). These results expanded our understanding of pathogenic viruses in waterfowl.\n\n(I-E) Works on SARS-CoV2 and Bourbon virus.\nI participated in the project to demonstrate the replication of SARS-CoV2 in human airway epithelium (mBio, 2020; Journal of Medical Virology, 2023) and establish a replicon reporter system of the emerging tick-borne Bourbon virus (Frontiers in Microbiology, 2020).",
