  "abstract": "Abstract\nHCMV encodes multiple proteins that suppress lytic phase immediate early (IE) transcription during latency.\nThese include Us28 and UL138. We identified a new repressor of the MIEP during latency: the Pentamer.\nThe Pentamer is a five-member glycoprotein complex consisting of gH, gL, UL128, UL130, and UL131 that\nis required for entry into epithelial and endothelial cells. We determined the Pentamer represses the MIEP\nduring both lytic and latent infections. Provocatively, we determined at least two different Pentamer alleles\nexist, one that strongly represses the MIEP, and one that weakly represses the MIEP. We hypothesize that\nHCMV uses unique Pentamer alleles to create different sub-sets of virions pre-programmed to either\ninitiate a lytic infection or to establish latency. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will create genetically\nmatched virus strains (laboratory and clinical) with pro-lytic or pro-latency Pentamer alleles and test them for\ntheir propensity to initiate lytic infection in fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells, to select against\nPentamer function during fibroblast propagation, and to establish latency in primary CD34+ cells. In Aim 2\nwe will determine the mechanism through which the Pentamer represses the MIEP.",
