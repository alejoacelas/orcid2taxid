      "title": "A screen for Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein binding to human hepatocyte surface receptors identifies novel host-pathogen interactions.",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes is an essential step in the Plasmodium life-cycle and has similarities, at the cellular level, to merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. In the case of the Plasmodium blood-stage, efforts to identify host-pathogen protein-protein interactions have yielded important insights including vaccine candidates. In the case of sporozoite-hepatocyte invasion, the host-pathogen protein-protein interactions involved are poorly understood.<h4>Methods</h4>To gain a better understanding of the protein-protein interaction between the sporozoite ligands and host receptors, a systematic screen was performed. The previous Plasmodium falciparum and human surface protein ectodomain libraries were substantially extended, resulting in the creation of new libraries comprising 88 P. falciparum sporozoite protein coding sequences and 182 sequences encoding human hepatocyte surface proteins. Having expressed recombinant proteins from these sequences, a plate-based assay was used, capable of detecting low affinity interactions between recombinant proteins, modified for enhanced throughput, to screen the proteins for interactions. The novel interactions identified in the screen were characterized biochemically, and their essential role in parasite invasion was further elucidated using antibodies and genetically manipulated Plasmodium parasites.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 7540 sporozoite-hepatocyte protein pairs were tested under conditions capable of detecting interactions of at least 1.2 µM K<sub>D</sub>. An interaction between the human fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the P. falciparum protein Pf34 is identified and reported here, characterizing its affinity and demonstrating the blockade of the interaction by reagents, including a monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, further interactions between Pf34 and a second P. falciparum rhoptry neck protein, PfRON6, and between human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the P. falciparum protein PIESP15 are identified. Conditional genetic deletion confirmed the essentiality of PfRON6 in the blood-stage, consistent with the important role of this protein in parasite lifecycle. Pf34 was refractory to attempted genetic modification. Antibodies to Pf34 abrogated the interaction and had a modest effect upon sporozoite invasion into primary human hepatocytes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pf34 and PfRON6 may be members of a functionally important invasion complex which could be a target for future interventions. The modified interaction screening assay, protein expression libraries and P. falciparum mutant parasites reported here may be a useful tool for protein interaction discovery and antigen candidate screening which could be of wider value to the scientific community.",

      "abstract": "The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations' \"100-day moonshot\" aspires to launch a new vaccine within 100 days of pathogen identification, followed by large-scale vaccine availability within the \"second hundred days.\" Here, we describe work to optimize adenoviral vector manufacturing for rapid response, by minimizing time to clinical trial and first large-scale supply, and maximizing output from the available manufacturing footprint. We describe a rapid virus seed expansion workflow that allows vaccine release to clinical trials within 60 days of antigen sequence identification, followed by vaccine release from globally distributed sites within a further 40 days. We also describe a perfusion-based upstream production process, designed to maximize output while retaining simplicity and suitability for existing manufacturing facilities. This improves upstream volumetric productivity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 by approximately fourfold and remains compatible with the existing downstream process, yielding drug substance sufficient for 10,000 doses from each liter of bioreactor capacity. This accelerated manufacturing process, along with other advantages such as thermal stability, supports the ongoing value of adenovirus-vectored vaccines as a rapidly adaptable and deployable platform for emergency response.",

      "abstract": "Sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes is an essential step in the Plasmodium life-cycle and has similarities, at the cellular level, to merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. In the case of the Plasmodium blood-stage, efforts to identify host-pathogen protein-protein interactions have yielded important insights including vaccine candidates. In the case of sporozoite-hepatocyte invasion, the host-pathogen protein-protein interactions involved are poorly understood. Here, we performed a systematic screen to identify such interactions. We substantially extended previous Plasmodium falciparum and human surface protein ectodomain libraries, creating new libraries containing 88 P. falciparum sporozoite protein coding sequences and 182 sequences encoding human hepatocyte surface proteins. Having expressed recombinant proteins from these sequences, we used a plate-based assay capable of detecting low affinity interactions between recombinant proteins, modified for enhanced throughput, to screen the proteins for interactions. We were able to test 7540 sporozoite-hepatocyte protein pairs under conditions capable of detecting interactions of at least 1.2µM KD. We report and characterise an interaction between human fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and the P. falciparum protein Pf34, characterising its affinity and demonstrating blockade of the interaction by reagents including a monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, we identify further interactions between Pf34 and a second P. falciparum rhoptry neck protein, PfRON6, and between human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and the P. falciparum protein PIESP15. Conditional genetic deletion confirmed the essentiality of PfRON6 in the blood-stage, consistent with the important role of this protein in parasite lifecycle. Pf34 was refractory to attempted genetic modification. Antibodies to Pf34 abrogated the interaction and had a modest effect upon sporozoite invasion into primary human hepatocytes. Pf34 and PfRON6 may be members of a functionally important invasion complex which could be a target for future interventions. The modified interaction screening assay, protein expression libraries and P. falciparum mutant parasites we report here may be a useful tool for protein interaction discovery and antigen candidate screening which could be of wider value to the scientific community.",

      "abstract": "Plasmodium sporozoites are extracellular forms introduced during mosquito bite that selectively invade mammalian hepatocytes. Sporozoites are delimited by a cell membrane that is linked to the underlying acto-myosin molecular motor. While membrane proteins with roles in motility and invasion have been well studied, very little is known about proteins that maintain the sporozoite shape. We demonstrate that in Plasmodium berghei (Pb) a conserved hypothetical gene, PBANKA_1422900 specifies sporozoite structural integrity maintenance protein (SIMP) required for maintaining the sporozoite shape and motility. Sporozoites lacking SIMP exhibited loss of regular shape, extensive membrane blebbing at multiple foci, and membrane detachment. The mutant sporozoites failed to infect hepatocytes, though the altered shape did not affect the organization of cytoskeleton or inner membrane complex (IMC). Interestingly, the components of IMC failed to extend under the membrane blebs likely suggesting that SIMP may assist in anchoring the membrane to IMC. Endogenous C-terminal HA tagging localized SIMP to membrane and revealed the C-terminus of the protein to be extracellular. Since SIMP is highly conserved among Plasmodium species, these findings have important implications for utilizing it as a novel sporozoite-specific vaccine candidate.",

      "abstract": "Rabies virus (RABV) causes lethal encephalitis and is responsible for approximately 60,000 deaths per year. As the sole virion-surface protein, the rabies virus glycoprotein (RABV-G) mediates host-cell entry. RABV-G's pre-fusion trimeric conformation displays epitopes bound by protective neutralizing antibodies that can be induced by vaccination or passively administered for post-exposure prophylaxis. We report a 2.8-Å structure of a RABV-G trimer in the pre-fusion conformation, in complex with two neutralizing and protective monoclonal antibodies, 17C7 and 1112-1, that recognize distinct epitopes. One of these antibodies is a licensed prophylactic (17C7, Rabishield), which we show locks the protein in pre-fusion conformation. Targeted mutations can similarly stabilize RABV-G in the pre-fusion conformation, a key step toward structure-guided vaccine design. These data reveal the higher-order architecture of a key therapeutic target and the structural basis of neutralization by antibodies binding two key antigenic sites, and this will facilitate the development of improved vaccines and prophylactic antibodies.",

      "abstract": "Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) are novel polymeric highly branched architectures with well-defined nano-size, narrow polydispersity index and numerous active amine functional groups at the periphery. The highly attractive feature of modifiable multiple surface functionalities facilitates conjugation of various ligands for cancer targeting, imaging and therapy. As well as, solubilization, high drug encapsulation, inherent passive targeting ability will also contribute to the therapeutic success of dendrimers. Cancer researchers are very eager about the utility of PAMAM dendrimer as a drug carrier and non-viral gene vector. This review highlighted the potential of non-targeted and ligand targeted surface engineered PAMAM dendrimers for the delivery of anticancer drugs and gene therapeutics and briefly focus on the diagnostic imaging applications of PAMAM dendrimers.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the scientific community to explore the complete potential of phytoconstituents, herbal or plant-based ingredients owing to a range of benefits they bring along. The herbal plants accommodate many phytoconstituents that are responsible for various activities such as anti-oxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hepatoprotective, etc. However, these phytoconstituents are highly sensitive to several environmental and physiological factors such as pH, oxygen, heat, temperature, humidity, stomach acid, enzymes, and light. Hence, there is need for the development of a drug delivery system that can protect the phytoconstituents from both internal and external conditions. In this regard, a microparticulate drug delivery system is considered amongst the ideal choice owing to its small size, ability to protect the environment-sensitive active constituents, in achieving sustained drug delivery, targeted drug delivery, protection of the drug from physiological conditions, minimizing drug-related side effects, etc.",

      "abstract": "Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a minimally invasive procedure for treating cancer. The two significant prerequisites of PTT are the photothermal therapeutic agent (PTA) and near-infrared radiation (NIR). The PTA absorbs NIR, causing hyperthermia in the malignant cells. This increased temperature at the tumor microenvironment finally results in tumor cell damage. Nanoparticles play a crucial role in PTT, aiding in the passive and active targeting of the PTA to the tumor microenvironment. Through enhanced permeation and retention effect and surface-engineering, specific targeting could be achieved. This novel delivery tool provides the advantages of changing the shape, size, and surface attributes of the carriers containing PTAs, which might facilitate tumor regression significantly. Further, inclusion of surface engineering of nanoparticles is facilitated through ligating ligands specific to overexpressed receptors on the cancer cell surface.

      "abstract": "The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that a rare population of stem-like cells underpin tumorigenesis. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) demonstrate novel mechanisms of targeting the elusive CSCs with greater selectivity - promising therapeutic potential against solid tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) that are resistant to conventional treatment. In general, OVs have failed to translate the efficacy from bench to bedside. The success of OVs rely on the hypothesis that eliminating CSCs is key to preventing recurrence. However, newly emerging evidence of CSC plasticity challenge this hypothesis by proposing that the CSC pool can be regenerated from non-CSCs post-treatment. We review this evidence surrounding the CSC hypothesis to propose an original perspective on why several advanced OVs may be failing to reflect their true potential in clinical trials. We argue that preventing non-CSC to CSC dedifferentiation may be critical to achieving long-term treatment efficacy in future OV clinical trials.",

      "title": "Will SARS-CoV-2 Infection Elicit Long-Lasting Protective or Sterilising Immunity? Implications for Vaccine Strategies (2020).",
      "abstract": "In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China resulted in the current COVID-19 global pandemic. The human immune system has not previously encountered this virus, raising the important question as to whether or not protective immunity is generated by infection. Growing evidence suggests that protective immunity can indeed be acquired post-infection-although a handful of reinfection cases have been reported. However, it is still unknown whether the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 leads to some degree of long-lasting protection against the disease or the infection. This review draws insights from previous knowledge regarding the nature and longevity of immunity to the related virus, SARS-CoV, to fill the gaps in our understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Deciphering the immunological characteristics that give rise to protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is critical to guiding vaccine development and also predicting the course of the pandemic. Here we discuss the recent evidence that characterises the adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its potential implications for the generation of memory responses and long-term protection.",

      "title": "Hypnotic and Melatonin/Melatonin-Receptor Agonist Treatment in Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic relapsing-remitting psychiatric disorder. Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances persist during acute mood episodes of the disorder and during euthymia. However, the treatment potential of hypnotic agents that might be used to manage sleep disturbance in BD is not well understood. Similarly, melatonin and medications with a melatonin-receptor agonist mechanism of action may have chronotherapeutic potential for treating people with the disorder, but the impact of these substances on sleep and circadian rhythms and core symptoms in BD is unclear.<h4>Objective</h4>Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the current evidence for hypnotic and melatonin/melatonin-receptor agonist pharmacotherapy for symptoms of sleep disturbance, mania, and depression in patients with BD.<h4>Methods</h4>AMED, Embase, MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases were searched for studies published in English from the date of inception to 31 October 2021. Studies included in this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-controlled/non-randomised studies for BD that examined hypnotic medications selected based on a common pattern of usage for treating insomnia (i.e. chloral, clomethiazole, diphenhydramine, doxepin, doxylamine, promethazine, suvorexant, zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) and melatonin and the melatonin-receptor agonist drugs ramelteon and agomelatine. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB2 and AXIS tools. Pooled effect sizes for RCT outcomes were estimated using random-effects models.<h4>Results</h4>A total of eleven studies (six RCTs and five experimental feasibility studies) involving 1279 participants were included. Each study examined melatonin or melatonin-receptor agonists. No studies of hypnotics were found that fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Pilot feasibility studies suggested beneficial treatment effects for symptoms of sleep disturbance, depression, and mania. However, the pooled effect of the two available RCT studies assessing sleep quality via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores was not statistically significant (g = - 0.04 [95% CI - 0.81 to 0.73]) and neither was the pooled effect for depressive symptoms (four studies; g = - 0.10 [95% CI - 0.27 to 0.08]). Some RCT evidence suggests ramelteon might prevent relapse into depression in BD. The largest efficacy signal detected was for manic symptoms (four studies; g = - 0.44 [95% CI - 1.03 to 0.14]) but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies and patient characteristics. In the two RCTs assessing manic symptoms during acute mania, adjunctive melatonin demonstrated superior treatment effects versus placebo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a paucity of studies examining pharmacological interventions for sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance in BD. Few studies assessed sleep-related symptoms, and none quantitatively examined endogenous melatonin patterns or other circadian rhythms. Melatonin may be a promising candidate for the adjunctive treatment of bipolar mania. However, dose-finding studies and studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm its efficacy. We recommend parallel monitoring of sleep and circadian rhythms in future trials. Chronobiology-informed trial designs are needed to improve the quality of future studies.<h4>Protocol registration</h4>PROSPERO (CRD42020167528).",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate COVID-19 infections and deaths in healthcare workers (HCWs) from a global perspective during the early phases of the pandemic.<h4>Design</h4>Systematic review.<h4>Methods</h4>Two parallel searches of academic bibliographic databases and grey literature were undertaken until 8 May 2020. Governments were also contacted for further information where possible. There were no restrictions on language, information sources used, publication status and types of sources of evidence. The AACODS checklist or the National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tools were used to appraise each source of evidence.<h4>Outcome measures</h4>Publication characteristics, country-specific data points, COVID-19-specific data, demographics of affected HCWs and public health measures employed.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 152 888 infections and 1413 deaths were reported. Infections were mainly in women (71.6%, n=14 058) and nurses (38.6%, n=10 706), but deaths were mainly in men (70.8%, n=550) and doctors (51.4%, n=525). Limited data suggested that general practitioners and mental health nurses were the highest risk specialities for deaths. There were 37.2 deaths reported per 100 infections for HCWs aged over 70 years. Europe had the highest absolute numbers of reported infections (119 628) and deaths (712), but the Eastern Mediterranean region had the highest number of reported deaths per 100 infections (5.7).<h4>Conclusions</h4>COVID-19 infections and deaths among HCWs follow that of the general population around the world. The reasons for gender and specialty differences require further exploration, as do the low rates reported in Africa and India. Although physicians working in certain specialities may be considered high risk due to exposure to oronasal secretions, the risk to other specialities must not be underestimated. Elderly HCWs may require assigning to less risky settings such as telemedicine or administrative positions. Our pragmatic approach provides general trends, and highlights the need for universal guidelines for testing and reporting of infections in HCWs.",

      "abstract": "A major issue in identification of protective T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 lies in distinguishing people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those with cross-reactive immunity generated by exposure to other coronaviruses. We characterised SARS-CoV-2 T cell immune responses in 168 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects and 118 seronegative subjects without known SARS-CoV-2 exposure using a range of T cell assays that differentially capture immune cell function. Strong ex vivo ELISpot and proliferation responses to multiple antigens (including M, NP and ORF3) were found in those who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were rare in pre-pandemic and unexposed seronegative subjects. However, seronegative doctors with high occupational exposure and recent COVID-19 compatible illness showed patterns of T cell responses characteristic of infection, indicating that these readouts are highly sensitive. By contrast, over 90% of convalescent or unexposed people showed proliferation and cellular lactate responses to spike subunits S1/S2, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive T cell populations. The detection of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critically dependent on the choice of assay and antigen. Memory responses to specific non-spike proteins provides a method to distinguish recent infection from pre-existing immunity in exposed populations.",

      "abstract": "The frequency of emerging disease is growing with ongoing human activity facilitating new host-pathogen interactions. Novel infection outcomes can also be shaped by the host microbiota. Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes experimentally colonised by a wild microbiota community and infected by the widespread animal pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, have been shown to suffer higher mortality than those infected by the pathogen alone. Understanding the host responses to such microbiota-pathogen ecological interactions is key to pinpointing the mechanism underlying severe infection outcomes. We conducted transcriptomic analyses of C. elegans colonised by its native microbiota, S. aureus and both in combination. Correlations between altered collagen gene expression and heightened mortality in co-colonised hosts suggest the microbiota modified host resistance to infection. Furthermore, microbiota colonised hosts showed increased expression of immunity genes and variable expression of stress response genes during infection. Changes in host immunity and stress response could encompass both causes and effects of severe infection outcomes. 'Re-wilding' this model nematode host with its native microbiota indicated that typically commensal microbes can mediate molecular changes in the host that are costly when challenged by a novel emerging pathogen.",

We have developed a live attenuated pertussis vaccine, named BPZE1, currently in advanced clinical development. Here, we examined the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of its pertactin-deficient derivative BPZE1P in a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airway inflammation (AAI). BPZE1P was given nasally either before or after sensitization with HDM, followed by HDM challenge, or between two challenge episodes. Vaccination prior to sensitization reduced resistance in the airways, the numbers of infiltrating eosinophils and the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-33, in the lungs but had no effect on Th2 cytokine levels. BPZE1P also protected when delivered after sensitization or between two challenge episodes. However, in this case the levels of Th2 cytokines in the lung were decreased without significant effects on IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-33 production. The vaccine restored lung function and decreased eosinophil influx in the lungs of HDM-treated mice. BPZE1P has a better take than BPZE1 in hosts vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccines. Therefore, it has interesting potential as a preventive and therapeutic agent against AAI, even in acellular pertussis-vaccinated populations.",

      "title": "The evolution of Bordetella pertussis has selected for mutations of acr that lead to sensitivity to hydrophobic molecules and fatty acids.",
      "abstract": "Whooping cough, or pertussis, is resurgent in numerous countries worldwide. This has renewed interest in Bordetella pertussis biology and vaccinology. The in vitro growth of B. pertussis has been a source of difficulty, both for the study of the organism and the production of pertussis vaccines. It is inhibited by fatty acids and other hydrophobic molecules. The AcrAB efflux system is present in many different bacteria and in combination with an outer membrane factor exports acriflavine and other small hydrophobic molecules from the cell. Here, we identify that the speciation of B. pertussis has selected for an Acr system that is naturally mutated and displays reduced activity compared to B. bronchiseptica, in which the system appears intact. Replacement of the B. pertussis locus with that of B. bronchiseptica conferred higher levels of resistance to growth inhibition by acriflavine and fatty acids. In addition, we identified that the transcription of the locus is repressed by a LysR-type transcriptional regulator. Palmitate de-represses the expression of the acr locus, dependent on the LysR regulator, strongly suggesting that it is a transcriptional repressor that is regulated by palmitate. It is intriguing that the speciation of B. pertussis has selected for a reduction in activity of the Acr efflux system that typically is regarded as protective to bacteria.",

      "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping cough, a serious respiratory infection causing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually worldwide. There are effective vaccines, but their production requires growing large quantities of B. pertussis. Unfortunately, B. pertussis has relatively slow growth in culture, with low biomass yields and variable growth characteristics. B. pertussis also requires a relatively expensive growth medium. We present a new, curated flux balance analysis-based model of B. pertussis metabolism. We enhance the model with an experimentally-determined biomass objective function, and we perform extensive manual curation. We test the model's predictions with a genome-wide screen for essential genes using a transposon-directed insertional sequencing (TraDIS) approach. We test its predictions of growth for different carbon sources in the medium. The model predicts essentiality with an accuracy of 83% and correctly predicts improvements in growth under increased glutamate:fumarate ratios. We provide the model in SBML format, along with gene essentiality predictions.",

This has been linked to the use of an acellular pertussis vaccine. In addition, it is thought that B. pertussis is adapting under acellular vaccine mediated immune selection pressure, towards vaccine escape. Genomics-based approaches have revolutionized the ability to resolve the fine structure of the global B. pertussis population and its evolution during the era of vaccination. Here, we discuss the current picture of B. pertussis evolution and diversity in the light of the current resurgence, highlight import questions raised by recent studies in this area and discuss the role that functional genomics can play in addressing current knowledge gaps.",

      "title": "Challenges in Developing a Controlled Human Tuberculosis Challenge Model.",
      "abstract": "Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) have provided pivotal scientific advancements, contributing to the licensure of new vaccines for many pathogens. Despite being one of the world's oldest known pathogens, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge surrounding the immunobiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Furthermore, the only licensed vaccine, BCG, is a century old and demonstrates limited efficacy in adults from endemic areas. Despite good global uptake of BCG, tuberculosis (TB) remains a silent epidemic killing 1.4 million in 2019 (WHO, Global tuberculosis report 2020). A mycobacterial CHIM could expedite the development pipeline of novel TB vaccines and provide critical understanding on the immune response to TB. However, developing a CHIM for such a complex organism is a challenging process. The first hurdle to address is which challenge agent to use, as it would not be ethical to use virulent M. tb. This chapter describes the current progress and outstanding issues in the development of a TB CHIM. Previous and current human studies include both aerosol and intradermal models using either BCG or purified protein derivative (PPD) as a surrogate agent. Future work investigating the use of attenuated M. tb is underway.",

      "abstract": "Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIMs) involve deliberately exposing healthy human volunteers to a known pathogen, to allow the detailed study of disease processes and evaluate methods of treatment and prevention, including next generation vaccines. CHIMs are in development for both tuberculosis (TB) and Covid-19, but challenges remain in their ongoing optimisation and refinement. It would be unethical to deliberately infect humans with virulent <i>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>), however surrogate models involving other mycobacteria, <i>M.tb</i> Purified Protein Derivative or genetically modified forms of <i>M.tb</i> either exist or are under development. These utilise varying routes of administration, including <i>via</i> aerosol, per bronchoscope or intradermal injection, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Intranasal CHIMs with SARS-CoV-2 were developed against the backdrop of the evolving Covid-19 pandemic and are currently being utilised to both assess viral kinetics, interrogate the local and systemic immunological responses post exposure, and identify immune correlates of protection. In future it is hoped they can be used to assess new treatments and vaccines. The changing face of the pandemic, including the emergence of new virus variants and increasing levels of vaccination and natural immunity within populations, has provided a unique and complex environment within which to develop a SARS-CoV-2 CHIM. This article will discuss current progress and potential future developments in CHIMs for these two globally significant pathogens.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>A SARS-CoV-2 controlled human infection model (CHIM) has been successfully established in seronegative individuals using a dose of 1×10<sup>1</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) pre-alpha SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the increasing prevalence of seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, a CHIM that could be used for vaccine development will need to induce infection in those with pre-existing immunity. Our aim was to find a dose of pre-alpha SARS-CoV-2 virus that induced infection in previously infected individuals.<h4>Methods</h4>Healthy, UK volunteers aged 18-30 years, with proven (quantitative RT-PCR or lateral flow antigen test) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (with or without vaccination) were inoculated intranasally in a stepwise dose escalation CHIM with either 1×10<sup>1</sup>, 1×10<sup>2</sup>, 1×10³, 1×10<sup>4</sup>, or 1×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2/human/GBR/484861/2020, the same virus used in the seronegative CHIM. Post-inoculation, volunteers were quarantined in functionally negative pressure rooms (Oxford, UK) for 14 days and until 12-hourly combined oropharyngeal-nasal swabs were negative for viable virus by focus-forming assay. Outpatient follow-up continued for 12 months post-enrolment, with additional visits for those who developed community-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary objective was to identify a safe, well tolerated dose that induced infection (defined as two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 positive PCRs starting 24 h after inoculation) in 50% of seropositive volunteers. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04864548); enrolment and follow-up to 12 months post-enrolment are complete.<h4>Findings</h4>Recruitment commenced on May 6, 2021, with the last volunteer enrolled into the dose escalation cohort on Nov 24, 2022. 36 volunteers were enrolled, with four to eight volunteers inoculated in each dosing group from 1×10<sup>1</sup> to 1×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> SARS-CoV-2. All volunteers have completed quarantine, with follow-up to 12 months complete. Despite dose escalation to 1×10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>, we were unable to induce sustained infection in any volunteers. Five (14%) of 36 volunteers were considered to have transient infection, based on the kinetic of their PCR-positive swabs. Transiently infected volunteers had significantly lower baseline mucosal and systemic SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titres and significantly lower peripheral IFNγ responses against a CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool than uninfected volunteers. 14 (39%) of 36 volunteers subsequently developed breakthrough infection with the omicron variant after discharge from quarantine. Most adverse events reported by volunteers in quarantine were mild, with fatigue (16 [44%]) and stuffy nose (16 [44%]) being the most common. There were no serious adverse events.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Our study demonstrates potent protective immunity induced by homologous vaccination and homologous or heterologous previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The community breakthrough infections seen with the omicron variant supports the use of newer variants to establish a model with sufficient rate of infection for use in vaccine and therapeutic development.<h4>Funding</h4>Wellcome Trust and Department for Health and Social Care.",

      "title": "THE SPLICING FACTOR PTBP1 REPRESSES <i>TP63 γ</i> ISOFORM PRODUCTION IN SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA",
      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> The TP63 gene encodes the transcription factor p63. It is frequently amplified or overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Owing to alternative splicing, p63 has multiple isoforms called α, β, γ and δ. The regulatory functions of p63 may be isoform-specific. The α isoform inhibits the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and controls apoptosis, while the γ isoform promotes EMT. Here, we observed in TCGA data that a high ratio of the TP63γ isoform to the other isoforms is a pejorative factor for the survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We therefore addressed the regulation of the γ isoform. In several tissues (GTEX data), the expression of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) is negatively correlated with the abundance of TP63γ . Accordingly, we demonstrated that PTBP1 depletion in HNSCC cell lines leads to an increase in abundance of the γ isoform. By RNA immunoprecipitation and in vitro interaction assays, we showed that PTBP1 directly binds to TP63 pre-mRNA in close proximity to the TP63γ -specific exon. The region around the TP63γ -specific exon was sufficient to elicit a PTBP1-dependent regulation of alternative splicing in a splice reporter minigene assay. Finally, we demonstrated that the regulation of TP63γ production by PTBP1 is conserved in amphibians, revealing that it encounters a strong evolutionary pressure. Together, these results identify TP63γ as a prognostic marker in HNSCC, and identify PTBP1 as a direct negative regulator of its production.",

Here, we demonstrate the involvement of the RNA-binding proteins CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of CD44 splicing. We show by FRET-FLIM that these proteins directly interact in the nucleus. By combining RNAi-mediated depletion and exon array hybridization in HeLa cells, we observe that the exons v7 to v10 of CD44 are highly sensitive to CELF1 and ELAVL1 depletion. We confirm by RT-PCR that CELF1 and ELAVL1 together stimulate the inclusion of these exons in CD44 mRNA. Finally, we show in eight different tumor types that high expression of CELF1 and/or ELAVL1 is correlated with the inclusion of CD44 variable exons. These data point to functional interactions between CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of CD44 splicing in human cancers.",

      "abstract": "<h4>ABSTRACT</h4> ELAVL1 and CELF1 are RNA-binding proteins that are involved in alternative splicing control. To explore their functional relationship, we looked for mRNAs that are differentially spliced following the depletion of CELF1, ELAVL1, or both. We found that these proteins control the usage of their target exons in the same direction. Double depletion has a greater effect than individual depletions, showing that CELF1 and ELAVL1 exert additive control. To confirm these results, we carried out RT-PCR on the alternative cassette exons of several mRNAs, including CD44, WNK1, PHACTR2, MICAL3, SPTBN1 , and PPP3CB . Using FRET, we found that CELF1 and ELAVL1 directly interact in cell nuclei. We demonstrated that the combined levels of CELF1 and ELAVL1 are a valuable biomarker in several cancers, even when their individual levels may yield very limited information. CD44 alternative splicing probably accounts in part for the effects of CELF1 and ELAVL1 levels on patient survival. These data point to strong functional interactions between CELF1 and ELAVL1 in the control of mRNA isoform production, resulting in significant impacts on human pathology.",

Several adjuvant compounds are being developed by the Vaccine Formulation Institute in Switzerland for global open access clinical use. In the context of the R21 malaria vaccine, in a mouse challenge model, we characterize the efficacy and mechanism of action of four Vaccine Formulation Institute adjuvants: two liposomal (LQ and LMQ) and two squalene emulsion-based adjuvants (SQ and SMQ), containing QS-21 saponin (Q) and optionally a synthetic TLR4 agonist (M). Two R21 vaccine formulations, R21/LMQ and R21/SQ, offer the highest protection (81%-100%), yet they trigger different innate sensing mechanisms in macrophages with LMQ, but not SQ, activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. The resulting in vivo adaptive responses have a different T<sub>H</sub>1/T<sub>H</sub>2 balance and engage divergent innate pathways while retaining high protective efficacy. We describe how modular changes in vaccine formulation allow for the dissection of the underlying immune pathways, enabling future mechanistically informed vaccine design.",

      "abstract": "Virus-like particles (VLPs) induce strong humoral and cellular responses and have formed the basis of some currently licensed vaccines. Here, we present the method used for the production of R21, a VLP-based anti-sporozoite malaria vaccine, under current Clinical Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (cGMP). Previous preclinical studies in BALB/c mice showed that R21 produced almost complete protection against sporozoite challenge with transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasites. Here, we have modified the preclinical production process to enable the production of sufficient quantities of highly pure, clinical-grade material for use in human clinical trials. The R21 construct was re-engineered to include a C-tag to allow affinity-based separation from the major contaminant alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX 1, ~74 kDa). To our knowledge, this is the first use of C-tag technology to purify a VLP vaccine candidate for use in human clinical trials. The R21 vaccine has shown high-level efficacy in an African Phase IIb trial, and multiple clinical trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Our findings support the future use of C-tag platform technologies to enable cGMP-compliant biomanufacturing of high purity yeast-expressed VLP-based vaccines for early phase clinical trials when clinical grade material is required in smaller quantities in a quick time frame.",

      "abstract": "To screen for additional vaccine candidate antigens of Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages, fourteen P. falciparum proteins were selected based on expression in sporozoites or their role in establishment of hepatocyte infection. For preclinical evaluation of immunogenicity of these proteins in mice, chimeric P. berghei sporozoites were created that express the P. falciparum proteins in sporozoites as an additional copy gene under control of the uis4 gene promoter. All fourteen chimeric parasites produced sporozoites but sporozoites of eight lines failed to establish a liver infection, indicating a negative impact of these P. falciparum proteins on sporozoite infectivity. Immunogenicity of the other six proteins (SPELD, ETRAMP10.3, SIAP2, SPATR, HT, RPL3) was analyzed by immunization of inbred BALB/c and outbred CD-1 mice with viral-vectored (ChAd63 or ChAdOx1, MVA) vaccines, followed by challenge with chimeric sporozoites. Protective immunogenicity was determined by analyzing parasite liver load and prepatent period of blood stage infection after challenge. Of the six proteins only SPELD immunized mice showed partial protection. We discuss both the low protective immunogenicity of these proteins in the chimeric rodent malaria challenge model and the negative effect on P. berghei sporozoite infectivity of several P. falciparum proteins expressed in the chimeric sporozoites.",

      "abstract": "More than 190 vaccines are currently in development to prevent infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Older adults (aged ≥70 years) are at increased risk of severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed. Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.<h4>Methods</h4>In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ≥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5-6·5 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA<sub>80</sub>). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137.<h4>Findings</h4>Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ≥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20 713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13 898-33 550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16 170 AU/mL [10 233-40 353], n=26; and ≥70 years 17 561 AU/mL [9705-37 796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA<sub>80</sub> at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and ≥70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and ≥70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48).<h4>Interpretation</h4>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.<h4>Funding</h4>UK Research and Innovation, National Institutes for Health Research (NIHR), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Thames Valley and South Midlands NIHR Clinical Research Network, and AstraZeneca.",

To determine its effects on humoral immunity, we conducted a proteomic analysis of polyclonal IgG antibodies directed against the NANP tetrapeptide of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) which comprises the vaccine’s core immunogen. In ten malaria-naïve adult volunteers, R21/Matrix-M induced polarized IgG anti-NANP repertoires, heavily skewed for IGHV3-30/3-33 genes bearing minimal somatic mutation, which remained static in composition following a controlled human malaria infection challenge. Notably, these vaccine-generated antibodies cross-reacted with another protective CSP epitope, the N-terminal junction region, despite its absence from the R21 construct. NANP-specific IGHV3-30/3-33 monoclonal antibodies mined from polyclonal IgG repertoires blocked sporozoite invasion in vitro and prevented parasitemia in vivo . Overall, R21/Matrix-M elicits polarized, minimally mutated, polyclonal IgG responses that can target multiple protective CSP epitopes, offering molecular insight into the serological basis for its demonstrated efficacy against P. falciparum malaria.",

      "abstract": "Falciparum malaria is a substantial public health problem. Vaccines and monoclonal antibodies targeting the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) circumsporozoite protein (CSP) are promising control strategies. The protective mechanisms of anti-PfCSP antibodies are incompletely understood, and levels of anti-PfCSP antibodies are inconsistently predictive of protection. We undertook controlled human malaria infections in volunteers vaccinated with the PfCSP-based vaccine R21/Matrix-M, using either intradermal injection (ID) or direct venous inoculation (DVI) of P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ Challenge). R21/Matrix-M was highly protective against intradermal inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge (i.e. 100%, 12 out of 12) but not protective against PfSPZ Challenge by DVI (i.e. 0%, 0 out of 5). These findings imply that the variable delivery of Pf sporozoites into capillaries rather than the subdermal layers by infectious mosquito bites can account for the inconsistent protection provided by anti-PfCSP antibodies.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background: </h4> Falciparum malaria remains a global health problem. Two vaccines, based on the circumsporozoite antigen, are available.  RTS, S/AS01 was recommended for use in 2021 following the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and WHO Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAG). It has since been pre-qualified in 2022 by the WHO. R21 is similar to RTS, S/AS01, and recently licensed in Nigeria, Ghana and Burkina Faso following Phase 3 trial results. <h4>Methods: </h4>: We conducted a Phase 1b age de-escalation, dose escalation bridging study after a change in the manufacturing process for R21. We recruited healthy adults and children and used a three dose primary vaccination series with a booster dose at 1–2 years. Variable doses of R21 and adjuvant (Matrix-M ™) were administered at 10µgR21/50 µg Matrix-M™, 5µgR21/25µg Matrix-M™ and 5µgR21/50µg Matrix-M™ to 20 adults, 20 children, and 51 infants. <h4>Results: </h4>: Self-limiting adverse events were reported relating to the injection site and mild systemic symptoms. Two serious adverse events were reported, neither linked to vaccination. High levels of IgG antibodies to the circumsporozoite antigen were induced, and geometric mean titres in infants, the target group, were 1.1 (0.9 to 1.3) EU/mL at day 0, 10175 (7724 to 13404) EU/mL at day 84 and (following a booster dose at day 421) 6792 (5310 to 8687) EU/mL at day 456. <h4>Conclusions: </h4>: R21/Matrix-M™ is safe, and immunogenic when given at varied doses with the peak immune response seen in infants 28 days after a three dose primary vaccination series given four weeks apart. Antibody responses were restored 28 days after a 4 th dose given one year post a three dose primary series in the young children and infants.

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The R21/Matrix-M vaccine has demonstrated high efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum clinical malaria in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Using trial data, we aimed to estimate the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccine introduction across sub-Saharan Africa.<h4>Methods</h4>We fitted a semi-mechanistic model of the relationship between anti-circumsporozoite protein antibody titres and vaccine efficacy to data from 3 years of follow-up in the phase 2b trial of R21/Matrix-M in Nanoro, Burkina Faso. We validated the model by comparing predicted vaccine efficacy to that observed over 12-18 months in the phase 3 trial. Integrating this framework within a mathematical transmission model, we estimated the cases, malaria deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and cost-effectiveness over a 15-year time horizon across a range of transmission settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Cost-effectiveness was estimated incorporating the cost of vaccine introduction (dose, consumables, and delivery) relative to existing interventions at baseline. We report estimates at a median of 20% parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years (PfPR<sub>2-10</sub>) and ranges from 3% to 65% PfPR<sub>2-10</sub>.<h4>Findings</h4>Anti-circumsporozoite protein antibody titres were found to satisfy the criteria for a surrogate of protection for vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria. Age-based implementation of a four-dose regimen of R21/Matrix-M vaccine was estimated to avert 181 825 (range 38 815-333 491) clinical cases per 100 000 fully vaccinated children in perennial settings and 202 017 (29 868-405 702) clinical cases per 100 000 fully vaccinated children in seasonal settings. Similar estimates were obtained for seasonal or hybrid implementation. Under an assumed vaccine dose price of US$3, the incremental cost per clinical case averted was $7 (range 4-48) in perennial settings and $6 (3-63) in seasonal settings and the incremental cost per DALY averted was $34 (29-139) in perennial settings and $30 (22-172) in seasonal settings, with lower cost-effectiveness ratios in settings with higher PfPR<sub>2-10</sub>.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Introduction of the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine could have a substantial public health benefit across sub-Saharan Africa.<h4>Funding</h4>The Wellcome Trust, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UK Medical Research Council, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership 2 and 3, the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the Serum Institute of India, Open Philanthropy.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p><bold>Background:</bold> The primary immunological readout for clinical vaccine trials of the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine, R21/MatrixM, is total IgG antibody specific to the central four amino acid (NANP) repeat region of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). A multiplexed Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay, which includes the NANP repeat region of CSP, was developed and validated. <bold>Methods:</bold> Here we describe the validation of a multiplexed MSD assay to measure serum or plasma antibody binding to four antigens: six repeats of the NANP repeat region of P. falciparum (Pf) CSP, the C-terminus (C-term) region of CSP, full length R21 vaccine construct, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Initial assay optimisation, which included validation of the HBsAg international standard, was performed by MSD. Further validation performed in Oxford covered intra and inter-assay, and inter-operator variability, accuracy of QC and standard curve samples, and included bridging between the singleplex ELISA used in previous R21/MM studies, and this multiplexed assay. <bold>Results:</bold> The multiplexed MSD assay was shown to be a robust and specific assay with a broad dynamic range. We report a strong linear relationship between NANP6 IgG as measured by the singleplex ELISA and the multiplexed assay. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This multiplexed MSD assay can be used to measure antibodies specific to the CSP NANP repeat region, CSP C-term region, full length R21 vaccine construct, and HBsAg. This assay can be used to determine humoral immune responses elicited by CSP-containing Pf malaria vaccines.</p>",

      "title": "Eosinophils as potential biomarkers in respiratory viral infections.",
      "abstract": "Eosinophils are bone marrow-derived granulocytes that, under homeostatic conditions, account for as much as 1-3% of peripheral blood leukocytes. During inflammation, eosinophils can rapidly expand and infiltrate inflamed tissues, guided by cytokines and alarmins (such as IL-33), adhesion molecules and chemokines. Eosinophils play a prominent role in allergic asthma and parasitic infections. Nonetheless, they participate in the immune response against respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. Notably, respiratory viruses are associated with asthma exacerbation. Eosinophils release several molecules endowed with antiviral activity, including cationic proteins, RNases and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. On the other hand, eosinophils release several cytokines involved in homeostasis maintenance and Th2-related inflammation. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, emerging evidence indicates that eosinophils can represent possible blood-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and severity prediction of disease. In particular, eosinopenia seems to be an indicator of severity among patients with COVID-19, whereas an increased eosinophil count is associated with a better prognosis, including a lower incidence of complications and mortality. In the present review, we provide an overview of the role and plasticity of eosinophils focusing on various respiratory viral infections and in the context of viral and allergic disease comorbidities. We will discuss the potential utility of eosinophils as prognostic/predictive immune biomarkers in emerging respiratory viral diseases, particularly COVID-19. Finally, we will revisit some of the relevant methods and tools that have contributed to the advances in the dissection of various eosinophil subsets in different pathological settings for future biomarker definition.",

      "abstract": "Immune cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) affect tumor progression and hold promise for therapeutic applications. Eosinophils are major effectors in Th2-related pathologies recently implied in cancer. Here, we evaluated the anti-tumor activities of eosinophil-derived EV following activation with the alarmin IL-33. We demonstrate that IL-33-activated mouse and human eosinophils produce higher quantities of EV with respect to eosinophils stimulated with IL-5. Following incorporation of EV from IL-33-activated eosinophils (Eo33-EV), but not EV from IL-5-treated eosinophils (Eo5-EV), mouse and human tumor cells increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI)-related genes resulting in cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, reduced proliferation and inhibited tumor spheroid formation. Moreover, tumor cells incorporating Eo33-EV acquired an epithelial-like phenotype characterized by E-Cadherin up-regulation, N-Cadherin downregulation, reduced cell elongation and migratory extent in vitro, and impaired capacity to metastasize to lungs when injected in syngeneic mice. RNA sequencing revealed distinct mRNA signatures in Eo33-EV and Eo5-EV with increased presence of tumor suppressor genes and enrichment in pathways related to epithelial phenotypes and negative regulation of cellular processes in Eo33-EV compared to Eo5-EV. Our studies underscore novel IL-33-stimulated anticancer activities of eosinophils through EV-mediated reprogramming of tumor cells opening perspectives on the use of eosinophil-derived EV in cancer therapy.",

      "title": "Basophils from allergy to cancer.",
      "abstract": "Human basophils, first identified over 140 years ago, account for just 0.5-1% of circulating leukocytes. While this scarcity long hampered basophil studies, innovations during the past 30 years, beginning with their isolation and more recently in the development of mouse models, have markedly advanced our understanding of these cells. Although dissimilarities between human and mouse basophils persist, the overall findings highlight the growing importance of these cells in health and disease. Indeed, studies continue to support basophils as key participants in IgE-mediated reactions, where they infiltrate inflammatory lesions, release pro-inflammatory mediators (histamine, leukotriene C<sub>4</sub>: LTC<sub>4</sub>) and regulatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13) central to the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. Studies now report basophils infiltrating various human cancers where they play diverse roles, either promoting or hampering tumorigenesis. Likewise, this activity bears remarkable similarity to the mounting evidence that basophils facilitate wound healing. In fact, both activities appear linked to the capacity of basophils to secrete IL-4/IL-13, with these cytokines polarizing macrophages toward the M2 phenotype. Basophils also secrete several angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factor: VEGF-A, amphiregulin) consistent with these activities. In this review, we feature these newfound properties with the goal of unraveling the increasing importance of basophils in these diverse pathobiological processes.",

      "abstract": "Trogocytosis is a cellular process whereby a cell acquires a membrane fragment from a donor cell in a contact-dependent manner allowing for the transfer of surface proteins with functional integrity. It is involved in various biological processes, including cell-cell communication, immune regulation, and response to pathogens and cancer cells, with poorly defined molecular mechanisms. With the exception of eosinophils, trogocytosis has been reported in most immune cells and plays diverse roles in the modulation of anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we report that eosinophils acquire membrane fragments from tumor cells early after contact through the CD11b/CD18 integrin complex. We discuss the impact of trogocytosis in innate immune cells on cancer progression in the context of the evidence that eosinophils can engage in trogocytosis with tumor cells. We also discuss shared and cell-specific mechanisms underlying this process based on <i>in silico</i> modeling and provide a hypothetical molecular model for the stabilization of the immunological synapse operating in granulocytes and possibly other innate immune cells that enables trogocytosis.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Personalized cancer therapy remains a challenge. In this context, we attempted to identify correlations between tumour angiogenesis, tumour metabolism and tumour cell type. To this aim, we used single=phase multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and hybrid positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) to determine whether net enhancement and standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were correlated with tumour size and cytology in patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).<h4>Material and methods</h4>Our study included 38 patients (30 men, 8 women, mean age 70) with a NSCLC measuring between 3 cm and 7 cm, using a 16-slice multidetector CT (Brilliance Philips) and with PET-CT (Biograph 16 Siemens Medical Solutions). The following lesion parameters were evaluated: maximum diameter, medium density before contrast injection (CTpre), medium density after contrast injection (CTpost average), density in the most enhanced part of the lesion after contrast (CTpost max), net enhancement, SUVmax, age, and cytology. Correlation coefficient and p-value were computed for each pair of variables. In addition, correlations were computed for each pair of variables, and for all combinations of tumour types. We focused on subsets of data with more than 10 observations, and with correlation r>0.500 and p<0.05.<h4>Results</h4>A weak correlation (r=0.32; p=0.048) was found between SUVmax and tumour size; the correlation was stronger for masses larger than 31 mm (r=0.4515; p=0.0268). No other correlations were found among the variables examined.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data may have prognostic significance, and could lead to more appropriate surgical treatment and better treatment outcome.",

Accompanying this is an increasing risk of human exposure to and injury from hazardous substances. Performing regular, structured surveillance of chemical incidents allows a greater awareness of the types of chemical hazards causing injury and the frequency of their occurrence, as well as providing a better understanding of exposures.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of performing event-based surveillance (EBS) and capturing chemical incidents is to use this information to increase the situational awareness of chemical incidents, improve the management of these incidents and to inform measures to protect public health.<h4>Methods</h4>This paper describes a method for EBS for chemical incidents, including the sources used, storing the gathered information and subsequent analysis of potential trends in the data.<h4>Results</h4>We describe trends in the type of incidents that have been detected, the chemicals involved in these incidents and the health effects caused, in different geographic regions of the world.<h4>Significance</h4>The methodology presented here provides a rapid and simple means of identifying chemical incidents that can be set up rapidly and with minimal cost, the outputs of which can be used to identify emerging risks and inform preparedness planning, response and training for chemical incidents.",

Although most are localised and have little impact, some affect wide areas, a range of sectors and may lead to many casualties. A public health response to assess the risks and provide advice to authorities and the public is usually required. In some cases, incidents may affect more than one country and require effective cross-border communication and coordination.<h4>Objective</h4>We describe tools and mechanisms to improve health security from cross-border chemical health threats and to support the implementation of the Decision of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (EU) on serious cross-border threats to health (Decision 1082/2013/EU).<h4>Methods</h4>Experts were recruited to a network and their suitability was assessed by using a skills framework. Input by relevant stakeholders such as the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, followed by EU-wide exercises, ensured that tools developed were fit for purpose.<h4>Results</h4>A network of public health risk assessors and a methodology for providing rapid independent expert public health advice during a chemical emergency have been developed.<h4>Significance</h4>We discuss the legacy of these mechanisms including their incorporation into the working arrangements for the EU Scientific Committee for Health, Environment and Emerging Risks and future developments in the field.",

      "title": "EU alerting and reporting systems for potential chemical public health threats and hazards.",
      "abstract": "A number of European and international IT platforms are used to notify competent authorities of new potential chemical exposures. Recently the European Parliament and the Council of European Union adopted new legislation that aims to improve the co-ordinated response to cross border health threats (Decision 1082/2013/EU). The Decision, inter alia, sets provisions on notification, ad hoc monitoring and coordination of public health measures following serious cross border threats to health from biological, chemical and environmental events as well as events that have an unknown origin. The legal instrument applies to all European Union Member States and is comparable to the International Health Regulations in its content, requirements and adoption of a multiple hazards approach. An inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary response to events with potentially dangerous cross border exposure pathways is often required. For example, European Poisons Centres may be aware of cases of toxic exposure to a product and, in parallel, trading standards may be aware of the same product due to a breach of consumer product standards. Whilst both cases would have been recorded for separate purposes in different alerting systems, they relate to the same exposure pathway; therefore a process for linking these records would allow a more robust approach to risk assessment and risk mitigation. The Decision seeks to reconcile this issue for serious threats by linking relevant platforms into one overarching higher level risk management IT platform called the Early Warning Response System (EWRS). This system will serve to link other sectors within the European Commission (EC) to public health (e.g. medicines), as well as other EU agencies and international bodies via co-notification features. Other European alert systems will be linked to EWRS to facilitate information sharing at both the assessment and management levels. This paper provides a timely overview of the main systems run by the EC and other international organisations that provide alerts following chemical incidents that have, or may have, the potential to affect public health. The advantages and further considerations of linking these different systems and sectors are also highlighted. Recommendations are made with the purpose of ensuring that modifications to these systems made to satisfy with EU legislation enable a more timely coordinated response and greater awareness of events in Europe, thereby reducing the public health impact from chemical exposures.",

      "title": "Development of a new categorization system for pesticides exposure to support harmonized reporting between EU Member States.",
      "abstract": "<h4>Objectives</h4>European legislation requires reporting from Member States on acute poisoning incidents involving pesticides. However, standard rules for data collection and reporting have not yet been set out. The new categorization system presented in this paper is aimed at enabling Member States to gather comparable data and provide standard reporting on pesticide poisoning exposures.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>European Regulations providing separate official categorization of biocidal and plant protection pesticides, were used as a basis to build up a unified pesticide categorization and coding system. Data on selected pesticide exposures collected by Poison Control Centres in six EU countries were reviewed, categorized and reported according to the proposed system.<h4>Results</h4>The resulting pesticide categorization system has two dimensions. The first part identifies the main category of use, i.e. biocide/plant protection pesticide/unknown, and the secondary category of use, e.g. Rodenticides, Insecticides and acaricides. The second part of the system is organized into two levels: level one identifies chemical grouping, e.g. Coumarins, Pyrethrins/pyrethroids, while level two identifies the active compound by using its Chemical Abstract Service Registry Number. The system was used to provide a unified categorization to compare exposures to plant protection and biocidal Rodenticides and Pyrethrins/pyrethroids Insecticides and acaricides identified by six EU member states.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The developed pesticide categorization system was successfully applied to data extracted from different databases and was able to make the required information comparable. The data reported filling in common templates containing a pre-ordinate list of active compounds categorized according the proposed system, highlighted different capabilities in data collection and recording, showing that some of the collaborating centres were not able to distinguish between main categories of pesticide products or provide information on active compounds. The results indicate that a special effort should be dedicated to support detailed data recording at national level. Providing common tools to systematically report to the EU Commission hazardous exposures to pesticides, as well as to other selected categories of products, could allow for data comparability between Member States and greatly improve post marketing surveillance and alerting systems in Europe.",

      "abstract": "One of the most developed theories of phospholipid homeostasis is the intrinsic curvature hypothesis, which, in broad terms, postulates that cells regulate their lipid composition so as to keep constant the membrane stored curvature elastic energy. The implication of this hypothesis is that lipid composition is determined by a ratio control function consisting of the weighted sum of concentrations of type II lipids in the numerator and the weighted sum of concentrations of Type 0 lipids in the denominator. In previous work we used a data-driven approach, based on lipidomic data from asynchronous cell cultures, to determine a criterion that allows the different lipid species to be assigned to the set of type 0 or of type II lipids, and hence construct a ratio control function that serves as a proxy for the lipid contribution to total membrane stored curvature elastic energy in vivo. Here we apply the curvature elastic energy proxy to the analysis of lipid composition data from synchronous HeLa cells as they traverse the cell cycle. Our analysis suggests HeLa cells modify their membrane stored elastic energy through the cell cycle. In S-phase type 0 lipids are the most abundant, whilst in G2 type II lipids are most abundant. Changes in our proxy for membrane stored elastic energy correlate with membrane curvature dependent processes in the HeLa cell around division, providing some insights into the interplay between the individual lipid and protein contributions to membrane free energy.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated thin-layer agar (TLA) as a faster alternative for both indirect minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of bedaquiline (BDQ) from culture isolates and direct drug-susceptibility testing (DST) from sputum samples. Indirect BDQ-MIC results from TLA were compared to the established 7H11 solid DST. Direct-TLA-DST performance was assessed using 143 baseline sputum samples from rifampicin-resistant TB cases. Direct-TLA tested susceptibility to rifampicin, isoniazid, levofloxacin, and BDQ, with results compared to Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) and MGIT. For indirect BDQ-MIC determination, TLA accurately identified H37Rv MICs within the WHO control range (0.015-0.12μg/mL). Optimal results were obtained with standard incubation and day 7 reading of the plates. TLA correctly classified all wild-type clinical strains as BDQ-susceptible and detected 9 out of 10 BDQ-resistant strains with elevated MICs. Direct-TLA-DST detected MTB in 53.8% of samples, compared to 55.9% on LJ and 69.4% in MGIT. Uninterpretable results due to contamination or medium drying were low (4.9%). The median time to result was 15 days for smear-positive and 22 days for smear-negative samples, faster than WHO-endorsed methods. Sensitivity was 100% for rifampicin and 87.8% for isoniazid, with a specificity of 100% for all drugs except isoniazid (96.2%). No BDQ nor levofloxacin resistance was detected, thus direct TLA sensitivity could not be assessed. In conclusion, direct-TLA-DST offers a reliable and faster alternative to conventional DST methods for BDQ and other anti-TB drugs. Essentially, this technique can be operated at BioSafety Level 2, allowing decentralization of pDST for managing drug-resistant TB in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure.<h4>Importance</h4>This paper addresses the critical need for faster direct drug-susceptibility testing (DST) on sputum, especially for bedaquiline (BDQ), which is a key drug in treating drug-resistant TB. Currently, there is a lack of rapid, reliable methods for direct BDQ testing from sputum samples, limiting timely and accurate treatment decisions and monitoring. By demonstrating the potential of thin-layer agar (TLA) for direct BDQ-MIC determination, this study offers a promising solution that could significantly improve patient care.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>An effective rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) treatment regimen should include prevention of resistance amplification. While bedaquiline (BDQ) has been recommended in all-oral RR-TB treatment regimen since 2019, resistance is rising at alarming rates. This may be due to BDQ's delayed bactericidal effect, which increases the risk of selecting for resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or BDQ in the first week of treatment when the bacterial load is highest. We aim to strengthen the first week of treatment with the injectable drug amikacin (AMK). To limit the ototoxicity risk while maximising the bactericidal effect, we will evaluate the safety of adding a 30 mg/kg AMK injection on the first and fourth day of treatment.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We will conduct a single-arm clinical trial on 20 RR-TB patients nested within an operational study called ShoRRT (All oral Shorter Treatment Regimen for Drug resistant Tuberculosis). In addition to all-oral RR-TB treatment, patients will receive two doses of AMK. The primary safety endpoint is any grade 3-4 adverse event during the first 2 weeks of treatment related to the use of AMK. With a sample size of 20 patients, we will have at least 80% statistical power to support the alternative hypothesis, indicating that less than 14% of patients treated with AMK experience a grade 3-4 adverse event related to its use. Safety data obtained from this study will inform a larger multicountry study on using two high doses of AMK to prevent acquired resistance.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of Rwanda, Rwanda Food and Drug Authority, Universitair Ziekenhuis, the Institute of Tropical Medicine ethics review board. All participants will provide informed consent. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conferences.<h4>Trial registration number</h4>NCT05555303.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The World Health Organization-endorsed phenotypic and genotypic drug-susceptibility testing (gDST/pDST) assays for the detection of rifampicin-resistant (RR) tuberculosis (TB), may miss some clinically relevant rpoB mutants, including borderline mutations and mutations outside the gDST-targeted hotspot region. Sequencing of the full rpoB gene is considered the reference standard for rifampicin DST but is rarely available in RR-TB endemic settings and when done indirectly on cultured isolates may not represent the full spectrum of mutations. Hence, in most such settings, the diversity and trends of rpoB mutations remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study included rpoB sequence data from a longitudinal collection of RR-TB isolates in Rwanda across 30 years (1991-2021).<h4>Results</h4>Of 540 successfully sequenced isolates initially reported as RR-TB, 419 (77.6%) had a confirmed RR conferring mutation. The Ser450 Leu mutation was predominant throughout the study period. The Val170Phe mutation, not covered by rapid gDST assays, was observed in only four patients, three of whom were diagnosed by pDST. Along with the transition from pDST to rapid gDST, borderline RR-associated mutations, particularly Asp435Tyr, were detected more frequently. Borderline mutants were not associated with HIV status but presented lower odds of having rpoA-C compensatory mutations than other resistance-conferring mutations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our analysis showed changes in the diversity of RR-TB conferring mutations throughout the study period that coincided with the switch of diagnostic tools to rapid gDST. The study highlights the importance of rapid molecular diagnostics reducing phenotypic bias in the detection of borderline rpoB mutations while vigilance for non-rifampicin resistance determinant region mutations is justified in any setting.",

      "abstract": "Delineating the origins and properties of antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination is critical for understanding their benefits and potential shortcomings. Therefore, we investigate the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-reactive B cell repertoire in unexposed individuals by flow cytometry and single-cell sequencing. We show that ∼82% of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive B cells harbor a naive phenotype, which represents an unusually high fraction of total human naive B cells (∼0.1%). Approximately 10% of these naive S-reactive B cells share an IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing, an enrichment of 18-fold compared to the complete naive repertoire. Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we report an average 37-fold enrichment of IGHV1-69/IGKV3-11 B cell receptor pairing in the S-reactive memory B cells compared to the unselected memory repertoire. This class of B cells targets a previously undefined non-neutralizing epitope on the S2 subunit that becomes exposed on S proteins used in approved vaccines when they transition away from the native pre-fusion state because of instability. These findings can help guide the improvement of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

      "abstract": "Eliciting potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a major goal in HIV-1 vaccine development. Here, we describe how germline-targeting immunogen BG505 SOSIP germline trimer 1.1 (GT1.1), generated through structure-based design, engages a diverse range of VRC01-class bnAb precursors. A single immunization with GT1.1 expands CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-specific VRC01-class B cells in knock-in mice and drives VRC01-class maturation. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), GT1.1 primes CD4bs-specific neutralizing serum responses. Selected monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from GT1.1-immunized NHPs neutralize fully glycosylated BG505 virus. Two mAbs, 12C11 and 21N13, neutralize subsets of diverse heterologous neutralization-resistant viruses. High-resolution structures revealed that 21N13 targets the same conserved residues in the CD4bs as VRC01-class and CH235-class bnAbs despite its low sequence similarity (~40%), whereas mAb 12C11 binds predominantly through its heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3. These preclinical data underpin the ongoing evaluation of GT1.1 in a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers.",

      "abstract": "Laminins are a major constituent of all basement membranes. The polymerisation of laminins at the cell surface is mediated by the three short arms of the cross-shaped laminin heterotrimer. The short arms contain repeats of laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domains, interspersed with globular domains of unknown function. A single LF domain is inserted between LE5 and LE6 of the laminin β1 and β2 chains. We report the crystal structure at 1.85Å resolution of the laminin β2 LE5-LF-LE6 region. The LF domain consists of a β-sandwich related to bacterial family 35 carbohydrate binding modules, and more distantly to the L4 domains present in the short arms of laminin α and γ chains. An α-helical region mediates the extensive interaction of the LF domain with LE5. The relative arrangement of LE5 and LE6 is very similar to that of consecutive LE domains in uninterrupted LE tandems. Fitting atomic models to a low-resolution structure of the first eight domains of the laminin β1 chain determined by small-angle X-ray scattering suggests a deviation from the regular LE array at the LE4-LE5 junction. These results advance our understanding of laminin structure.",

      "abstract": "Laminins are cell-adhesive glycoproteins that are essential for basement membrane assembly and function. Integrins are important laminin receptors, but their binding site on the heterotrimeric laminins is poorly defined structurally. We report the crystal structure at 2.13 Å resolution of a minimal integrin-binding fragment of mouse laminin-111, consisting of ∼50 residues of α1β1γ1 coiled coil and the first three laminin G-like (LG) domains of the α1 chain. The LG domains adopt a triangular arrangement, with the C terminus of the coiled coil situated between LG1 and LG2. The critical integrin-binding glutamic acid residue in the γ1 chain tail is surface exposed and predicted to bind to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site in the integrin β1 subunit. Additional contacts to the integrin are likely to be made by the LG1 and LG2 surfaces adjacent to the γ1 chain tail, which are notably conserved and free of obstructing glycans.",

      "abstract": "The development of novel treatment against tuberculosis is a priority global health challenge. Antimicrobial proteins and peptides offer a multifaceted mechanism suitable to fight bacterial resistance. Within the RNaseA superfamily there is a group of highly cationic proteins secreted by innate immune cells with anti-infective and immune-regulatory properties. In this work, we have tested the human canonical members of the RNase family using a spot-culture growth inhibition assay based mycobacteria-infected macrophage model for evaluating their anti-tubercular properties. Out of the seven tested recombinant human RNases, we have identified two members, RNase3 and RNase6, which were highly effective against <i>Mycobacterium aurum</i> extra- and intracellularly and induced an autophagy process. We observed the proteins internalization within macrophages and their capacity to eradicate the intracellular mycobacterial infection at a low micro-molar range. Contribution of the enzymatic activity was discarded by site-directed mutagenesis at the RNase catalytic site. The protein induction of autophagy was analyzed by RT-qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Specific blockage of auto-phagosome formation and maturation reduced the protein's ability to eradicate the infection. In addition, we found that the <i>M. aurum</i> infection of human THP1 macrophages modulates the expression of endogenous RNase3 and RNase6, suggesting a function <i>in vivo</i>. Overall, our data anticipate a biological role for human antimicrobial RNases in host response to mycobacterial infections and set the basis for the design of novel anti-tubercular drugs.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a devastating infectious disease and remerges as a global health emergency due to an alarming rise of antimicrobial resistance to its treatment. Despite of the serious effort that has been applied to develop effective antitubercular chemotherapies, the potential of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) remains underexploited. A large amount of literature is now accessible on the AMP mechanisms of action against a diversity of pathogens; nevertheless, research on their activity on mycobacteria is still scarce. In particular, there is an urgent need to integrate all available interdisciplinary strategies to eradicate extensively drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strains. In this context, we should not underestimate our endogenous antimicrobial proteins and peptides as ancient players of the human host defense system. We are confident that novel antibiotics based on human AMPs displaying a rapid and multifaceted mechanism, with reduced toxicity, should significantly contribute to reverse the tide of antimycobacterial drug resistance. In this review, we have provided an up to date perspective of the current research on AMPs to be applied in the fight against TB. A better understanding on the mechanisms of action of human endogenous peptides should ensure the basis for the best guided design of novel antitubercular chemotherapeutics.",

Microbes have evolved a diverse range of strategies to avoid triggering inflammatory responses. However, some pathogens, such as the influenza virus and the Gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, do trigger life-threatening \"cytokine storms\" in the host which can result in significant pathology and ultimately death. For these diseases, it has been proposed that downregulating inflammatory immune responses may improve outcome. We review some of the current candidates for treatment of cytokine storms which may prove useful in the clinic in the future and compare them to more traditional therapeutic candidates that target the pathogen rather than the host response.",

      "abstract": "Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) variants of P. vivax, besides having variations in the protein repetitive portion, can differ from each other in aspects such as geographical distribution, intensity of transmission, vectorial competence and immune response. Such aspects must be considered to P. vivax vaccine development. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity of novel recombinant proteins corresponding to each of the three P. vivax allelic variants (VK210, VK247 and P. vivax-like) and of the C-terminal region (shared by all PvCSP variants) in naturally malaria-exposed populations of Brazilian Amazon. Our results demonstrated that PvCSP-VK210 was the major target of humoral immune response in studied population, presenting higher frequency and magnitude of IgG response. The IgG subclass profile showed a prevalence of cytophilic antibodies (IgG1 and IgG3), that seem to have an essential role in protective immune response. Differently of PvCSP allelic variants, antibodies elicited against C-terminal region of protein did not correlate with epidemiological parameters, bringing additional evidence that humoral response against this protein region is not essential to protective immunity. Taken together, these findings increase the knowledge on serological response to distinct PvCSP allelic variants and may contribute to the development of a global and effective P. vivax vaccine.",

      "title": "Vaccinia Virus Uses Retromer-Independent Cellular Retrograde Transport Pathways To Facilitate the Wrapping of Intracellular Mature Virions during Virus Morphogenesis.",
      "abstract": "Poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (VACV), undertake a complex cytoplasmic replication cycle which involves morphogenesis through four distinct virion forms and includes a crucial wrapping step whereby intracellular mature virions (IMVs) are wrapped in two additional membranes to form intracellular enveloped virions (IEVs). To determine if cellular retrograde transport pathways are required for this wrapping step, we examined VACV morphogenesis in cells with reduced expression of the tetrameric tethering factor known as the GARP (Golgi-associated retrograde pathway), a central component of retrograde transport. VACV multistep replication was significantly impaired in cells transfected with small interfering RNA targeting the GARP complex and in cells with a mutated GARP complex. Detailed analysis revealed that depletion of the GARP complex resulted in a reduction in the number of IEVs, thereby linking retrograde transport with the wrapping of IMVs. In addition, foci of viral wrapping membrane proteins without an associated internal core accumulated in cells with a mutated GARP complex, suggesting that impaired retrograde transport uncouples nascent IMVs from the IEV membranes at the site of wrapping. Finally, small-molecule inhibitors of retrograde transport strongly suppressed VACV multistep growth <i>in vitro</i> and reduced weight loss and clinical signs in an <i>in vivo</i> murine model of systemic poxviral disease. This work links cellular retrograde transport pathways with the morphogenesis of poxviruses and identifies a panel of novel inhibitors of poxvirus replication. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Cellular retrograde transport pathways traffic cargo from endosomes to the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network and are a key part of the intracellular membrane network. This work reveals that the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) exploits cellular retrograde transport pathways to facilitate the wrapping of intracellular mature virions and therefore promote the production of extracellular virus. Inhibition of retrograde transport by small-molecule inhibitors reduced the replication of VACV in cell culture and alleviated disease in mice experimentally infected with VACV. This research provides fundamental new knowledge about the wrapping step of poxvirus morphogenesis, furthers our knowledge of the complex cellular retrograde pathways, and identifies a new group of antipoxvirus drugs.",

      "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging mosquito-borne virus that causes swift outbreaks. Major concerns are the persistent and disabling polyarthralgia in infected individuals. Here we present the results from a first-in-human trial of the candidate simian adenovirus vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 Chik, expressing the CHIKV full-length structural polyprotein (Capsid, E3, E2, 6k and E1). 24 adult healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years, were recruited in a dose escalation, open-label, nonrandomized and uncontrolled phase 1 trial (registry NCT03590392). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 Chik at one of the three preestablished dosages and were followed-up for 6 months. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 Chik. The secondary objective was to assess the humoral and cellular immunogenicity. ChAdOx1 Chik was safe at all doses tested with no serious adverse reactions reported. The vast majority of solicited adverse events were mild or moderate, and self-limiting in nature. A single dose induced IgG and T-cell responses against the CHIKV structural antigens. Broadly neutralizing antibodies against the four CHIKV lineages were found in all participants and as early as 2 weeks after vaccination. In summary, ChAdOx1 Chik showed excellent safety, tolerability and 100% PRNT<sub>50</sub> seroconversion after a single dose.",

      "abstract": "Medical countermeasures to treat biothreat agent infections require broad-spectrum therapeutics that do not induce agent resistance. A cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) against ricin toxin combined with hit optimization allowed selection of a family of compounds that meet these requirements. The hit compound Retro-2 and its derivatives have been demonstrated to be safe in vivo in mice even at high doses. Moreover, Retro-2 is an inhibitor of retrograde transport that affects syntaxin-5-dependent toxins and pathogens. As a consequence, it has a broad-spectrum activity that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo against ricin, Shiga toxin-producing O104:H4 entero-hemorrhagic E. coli and Leishmania sp. and in vitro against Ebola, Marburg and poxviruses and Chlamydiales. An effect is anticipated on other toxins or pathogens that use retrograde trafficking and syntaxin-5. Since Retro-2 targets cell components of the host and not directly the pathogen, no selection of resistant pathogens is expected. These lead compounds need now to be developed as drugs for human use.",

      "abstract": "Oncological disease in the palliative stage is a huge challenge for patients and their family caregivers (FCs) due to the fact that it confronts them with death, as well as physical, psychological, and existential suffering. Meaning of Life Therapy (MLT) is a brief structured psycho-existential intervention aiming to help patients in a meaning-making life review process, promoting end-of-life adaptation. The Life Letter (LL) resulting from MLT is an element that facilitates communication between the patient and their caregivers. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of MLT on the grieving processes of eight FCs and to study their perceptions of the role of the LL on grief through semi-structured interviews. The results of our qualitative analysis indicate that MLT was perceived by the FCs as a positive experience despite the conspiracy of silence being identified as a drawback. The LL was interpreted as a communicational element, promoting emotional closeness with the cancer patients and serving as a valuable tool in the FCs' adaptation to loss. Our research findings show that the needs of FCs, especially after experiencing the loss of their relative, are dynamic and specific. This is why it is urgent to develop interventions that consider the idiosyncrasies of end-of-life cancer patients and their FCs in order to avoid frustrated farewells, lonely deaths, and maladaptive grieving processes. This is the direction in which MLT should evolve.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the use of a microwave reactor, which allowed high input of energy into a pressurised system in a short period of time, was investigated for preparation of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The aim was to optimise the formulation process by reducing manufacturing time. Two types of LNPs were prepared; non-ionic surfactant vesicles (NISV) and bilosomes (modified NISV incorporating bile salts), with a model antigen (tetanus toxoid, TT) and the immune response induced after mucosal (nasal and oral, respectively) administration was assessed. The TT loaded LNPs were characterised in terms of particle size, size distribution, morphology, and entrapment efficiency. Immunisation was evaluated by lethal challenge with tetanus toxin in an animal model. The efficiency of vaccination was evaluated by measuring the anti-TT IgG antibody levels in the vaccinated animals. Bilosomes formed by this method showed an immunogen entrapment efficiency of ∼30% which was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than entrapment efficiency in the NISV. The percentage of animals that survived when challenged with tetanus toxin correlated with the level of IgG determined in the serum of mice immunised with LNPs by the mucosal route. Moreover, there were significant (p < 0.05) differences between orally and nasally immunised groups. Animal groups immunised bilosomes via the oral route showed the highest level of IgG (1.2 ± 0.13) compared to the positive control, LN + Xn, and no immunised group. Similarly, groups immunised via the nasal route showed significantly (p < 0.0001) higher titres compared with the control group. Mucosal TT was capable of inducing systemic specific IgG anti-TT responses that were higher than the parenteral vaccine.",

      "abstract": "Antibodies play a crucial role in the immune response, in fighting off pathogens as well as helping create strong immunological memory. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) occurs when non-neutralising antibodies recognise and bind to a pathogen, but are unable to prevent infection, and is widely known and is reported as occurring in infection caused by several viruses. This narrative review explores the ADE phenomenon, its occurrence in viral infections and evaluates its role in infection by SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of yet, there is no clear evidence of ADE in SARS-CoV-2, though this area is still subject to further study.",

      "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is the cause of 20% of Canadian deaths per year. Nicotine vaccines present a promising alternative to traditional smoking cessation products, but to date, no vaccine has been able to move through all phases of clinical trials. We have previously demonstrated that the AFPL1-conjugate nicotine vaccine does not induce systemic or immunotoxicity in a mouse model and that a heterologous vaccination approach is more advantageous than the homologous routes to inducing mucosal and systemic anti-nicotine antibodies. The purpose of this study was to confirm the safety profile of the vaccine in a repeat-dose toxicity study. The heterologous vaccination strategy was again used, and Sprague Dawley rats were administered a dose five times greater than in our previous studies. Physiological conditions, food and water consumption, body temperature, injection site inflammation, relative weights of organs, histopathology, and blood chemistry and hematology were evaluated during the course of the vaccination period to determine the safety of the vaccine. The AFPL1-conjugate nicotine vaccine did not induce clinically relevant changes or induce symptoms that would be associated with toxicity, making it a promising candidate for future investigations.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortality due to infectious diseases. The development of new generation vaccines against TB is of paramount importance for the control of the disease. In previous studies, liposomes obtained from lipids of Mycobacterium smegmatis (LMs) demonstrated their immunogenicity and protective capacity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mice. To characterize the immunomodulatory capacity of this experimental vaccine candidate, in the current study, the stimulatory capacity of LMs was determined on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from mice.<h4>Methods</h4>LMs were obtained and incubated with mature BMDCs. The internalization of LMs by BMDCs was studied by confocal microscopy, and the LMs immune-stimulatory capacity was determined by the expression of surface molecules (CD86 and MHCII) and the cytokine production (interleukin [IL]-12, interferon-Υ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-10) 24 h after exposure to LMs.<h4>Results</h4>The interaction of LMs with BMDCs and its internalization was demonstrated as well as the immune activation of BMDCs, characterized by the increased expression of CD86 and the production of IL-12. The LMs internalization and immune activation of BMDCs were blocked in the presence of cytochalasin, filipin III and chlorpromazine, which demonstrated that internalization of LMs by BMDCs is a key process for the LMs induced immune activation of BMDCs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results obtained support the further evaluation of LMs as a mycobacterial vaccine, adjuvant, and in immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Adenoviral vectors induce robust epitope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Within the repertoire of responses generated both conventional memory evolution and the phenomenon of memory inflation are seen. The rules governing which epitopes inflate are not fully known, but may include a role for both antigen processing and competition. To investigate this, we looked at memory generated from vectors targeting the Gp33-41 (KAVYNFATC/K9C) epitope from the gp of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice. This well-described epitope has both the Gp33-41 and Gp34-41 epitopes embedded within it. Vaccination with a full-length gp or a minigene Ad-Gp33/K9C vector-induced conventional memory responses against the immunodominant Gp33/K9C epitope but a strong inflationary response against the Gp34/A8C epitope. These responses showed sustained in vivo function, with complete protection against LCMV infectious challenge. Given the unexpected competition between epitopes seen in the minigene model, we further tested epitope competition using the full-length Ad-LacZ (β-galactosidase) model. Generation of an Ad-LacZ vector with a single amino acid disruption of the inflationary β-gal<sub>96-103</sub> /D8V epitope transformed the β-gal<sub>497-504</sub> /I8V epitope from conventional to inflationary memory. This work collectively demonstrates the importance of epitope competition within adenoviral vector inserts and is of relevance to future studies using adenoviral vectored immunogens.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Viral genetic variability presents a major challenge to the development of a prophylactic hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine. A promising HCV vaccine using chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAd) encoding a genotype (gt) 1b non-structural protein (ChAd-Gt1b-NS) generated high magnitude T cell responses. However, these T cells showed reduced cross-recognition of dominant epitope variants and the vaccine has recently been shown to be ineffective at preventing chronic HCV. To address the challenge of viral diversity, we developed ChAd vaccines encoding HCV genomic sequences that are conserved between all major HCV genotypes and adjuvanted by truncated shark invariant chain (sIi<sub>tr</sub>).<h4>Methods</h4>Age-matched female mice were immunised intramuscularly with ChAd (10<sup>8</sup> infectious units) encoding gt-1 and -3 (ChAd-Gt1/3) or gt-1 to -6 (ChAd-Gt1-6) conserved segments spanning the HCV proteome, or gt-1b (ChAd-Gt1b-NS control), with immunogenicity assessed 14-days post-vaccination.<h4>Results</h4>Conserved segment vaccines, ChAd-Gt1/3 and ChAd-Gt1-6, generated high-magnitude, broad, and functional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Compared to the ChAd-Gt1b-NS vaccine, these vaccines generated significantly greater responses against conserved non-gt-1 antigens, including conserved subdominant epitopes that were not targeted by ChAd-Gt1b-NS. Epitopes targeted by the conserved segment HCV vaccine induced T cells, displayed 96.6% mean sequence homology between all HCV subtypes (100% sequence homology for the majority of genotype-1, -2, -4 sequences and 94% sequence homology for gt-3, -6, -7, and -8) in contrast to 85.1% mean sequence homology for epitopes targeted by ChAd-Gt1b-NS induced T cells. The addition of truncated shark invariant chain (sIi<sub>tr</sub>) increased the magnitude, breadth, and cross-reactivity of the T cell response.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have demonstrated that genetically adjuvanted ChAd vectored HCV T cell vaccines encoding genetic sequences conserved between genotypes are immunogenic, activating T cells that target subdominant conserved HCV epitopes. These pre-clinical studies support the use of conserved segment HCV T cell vaccines in human clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aims</h4>A prophylactic vaccine targeting multiple HCV genotypes (gt) is urgently required to meet World Health Organization elimination targets. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV, and each may contribute to protective immunity. However, current vaccine candidates generate either nAbs or T cells targeting genetically variable epitopes and have failed to show efficacy in human trials. We have previously shown that a simian adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) encoding conserved sequences across gt1-6 (ChAd-Gt1-6), and separately gt-1a E2 protein with variable regions deleted (E2Δ123<sub>HMW</sub> ), generates pan-genotypic T cells and nAbs, respectively. We now aim to develop a vaccine to generate both viral-specific B- and T-cell responses concurrently.<h4>Approach and results</h4>We show that vaccinating with ChAd-Gt1-6 and E2Δ123<sub>HMW</sub> sequentially in mice generates T-cell and antibody (Ab) responses comparable to either vaccine given alone. We encoded E2Δ123 in ChAdOx1 (ChAd-E2Δ123) and show that this, given with an E2Δ123<sub>HMW</sub> protein boost, induces greater CD81-E2 inhibitory and HCV-pseudoparticle nAb titers compared to the E2Δ123<sub>HMW</sub> prime boost. We developed bivalent viral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 and modified vaccinia Ankara [MVA]) encoding both Gt1-6 and E2Δ123 immunogens (Gt1-6-E2Δ123) generating polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and nAb titers in prime/boost strategies. This approach generated nAb responses comparable to monovalent E2Δ123 ChAd/MVA vaccines and superior to three doses of recombinant E2Δ123<sub>HMW</sub> protein, while also generating high-magnitude T-cell responses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data are an important step forward for the development of a pan-genotype HCV vaccine to elicit T cells and nAbs for future assessment in humans.",

      "abstract": "Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells can be activated by viruses through a cytokine-dependent mechanism, and thereby protect from lethal infection. Given this, we reasoned MAIT cells may have a critical role in the immunogenicity of replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors, which are novel and highly potent vaccine platforms. In vitro , ChAdOx1 (Chimpanzee Adenovirus Ox1) induced potent activation of MAIT cells. Activation required transduction of monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells to produce IL-18 and IFN-α, respectively. IFN-α-induced monocyte-derived TNF-α was identified as a novel intermediate in this activation pathway, and activation required combinatorial signaling of all three cytokines. Furthermore, ChAdOx1-induced in vivo MAIT cell activation in both mice and human volunteers. Strikingly, MAIT cell activation was necessary in vivo for development of ChAdOx1-induced HCV-specific CD8 T cell responses. These findings define a novel role for MAIT cells in the immunogenicity of viral vector vaccines, with potential implications for future design. <h4>One sentence summary</h4> Robust immunogenicity of candidate adenovirus vaccine vectors requires the activation of unconventional T cells.",

      "abstract": "Morbilliviruses form a closely related group of pathogenic viruses which encode three non-structural proteins V, W and C in their P gene. Previous studies with rinderpest virus (RPV) and measles virus (MeV) have demonstrated that these non-structural proteins play a crucial role in blocking type I (IFNα/β) and type II (IFNγ) interferon action, and various mechanisms have been proposed for these effects. We have directly compared four important morbilliviruses, rinderpest (RPV), measles virus (MeV), peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and canine distemper virus (CDV). These viruses and their V proteins could all block type I IFN action. However, the viruses and their V proteins had varying abilities to block type II IFN action. The ability to block type II IFN-induced gene transcription correlated with co-precipitation of STAT1 with the respective V protein, but there was no correlation between co-precipitation of either STAT1 or STAT2 and the abilities of the V proteins to block type I IFN-induced gene transcription or the creation of the antiviral state. Further study revealed that the V proteins of RPV, MeV, PPRV and CDV could all interfere with phosphorylation of the interferon-receptor-associated kinase Tyk2, and the V protein of highly virulent RPV could also block the phosphorylation of another such kinase, Jak1. Co-precipitation studies showed that morbillivirus V proteins all form a complex containing Tyk2 and Jak1. This study highlights the ability of morbillivirus V proteins to target multiple components of the IFN signalling pathways to control both type I and type II IFN action.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title><p><bold>Background</bold>Diarrhoea is one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) among children below five years, though the proportion of the burden occurring amongst those aged over 70 is increasing. The cost of treating and managing diarrhoea can place a burden on individuals, their households, and society in general. The cost can be high but is often undocumented, and many studies focus on children or hospitalised patients only. This study aimed to estimate the economic cost per case of diarrhoea amongst individuals of any age in Uvira, Democratic Republic of the Congo.<bold>Methods</bold>The study was cross-sectional and retrospective, and based on a household survey approximately representative of the city undertaken in September 2021. Data on quantities and prices of resources were collected in the survey, as well as interviews with staff at the Cholera Treatment Centre in the Uvira general hospital and their records on resource use and patient numbers. Direct and indirect costs were measured from the societal perspective, and multiple linear regression used to identify cost drivers.<bold>Results</bold>Of 2,820 members of the 528 households surveyed, 175 people (6.2%) were reported to have had diarrhoea in the previous seven days. The majority sought care (86%) of which most (63%) visited a pharmacy. The average economic cost of illness (COI) for an episode of diarrhoea was 33,366 Congolese Francs (CDF) (US$ 16.8). The median was CDF 14,000 (US$ 7.0). The average out of pocket financial COI to patients was CDF 15,111 (US$ 7.6), representing 9% of the estimated average monthly income of households. On average caregivers and patients lost 4 days per episode. A concentration index suggested a lower economic COI among poorer households (p = 0.096). A regression analysis identified that being older than 5 years or being water insecure (p = 0.029) were associated with higher COI.<bold>Conclusion</bold>Households in Uvira experience many diarrhoeal episodes per year, and the COI is an important burden for them and society. These costs could be avoided if diarrhoea were prevented through public health interventions, and if care-seeking was better managed to ensure appropriate treatment.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4> Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant health issue in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, and artisanal mining (AM) may be a contributing factor. However, no systematic review has investigated the association between AM and TB in SSA. Therefore, this study aims to assess the burden of TB among artisanal miners in SSA. <h4>Methods</h4> We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline-OVID, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for studies on AM and TB published up to January 25, 2022. We presented the findings of seven studies that met our inclusion criteria narratively and through figure synthesis, and used inverse-variance weighted random-effects models to combine effect estimates for meta-analysis. <h4>Results</h4> The overall prevalence of TB among artisanal workers was estimated to be 15% (95%CI: 8, 23), with higher rates in high TB burden countries (19%, 95%CI: 11, 28) compared to upper-moderate burden countries (8%, 95%CI: 3, 19. Further, exposure to silica dust, a common byproduct of AM, significantly increased the incidence of TB, with a pooled relative risk of 2.19 (95% CI: 1.77, 2.71). Additionally, we found that a higher number of artisanal miners in Ghana was associated with a reduction in TB incidence. <h4>Conclusion</h4> Our findings suggest that exposure to silica dust in AM is a neglected but a significant risk factor for TB in SSA. More studies and efforts are needed to address this threat to TB control.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>A global shortage of cholera vaccines has increased the use of single-dose regimens, rather than the standard two-dose regimen. There is sparse evidence on single-dose protection, particularly in children. In 2020, a mass vaccination campaign was conducted in Uvira, an endemic urban setting in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, resulting in largely single-dose coverage. We examined the effectiveness of a single-dose of the oral cholera vaccine Euvichol-Plus in this high-burden setting.<h4>Methods</h4>In this matched case-control study, we recruited individuals with medically attended confirmed cholera in the two cholera treatment facilities in the city of Uvira. The control group consisted of age-matched, sex-matched, and neighbourhood-matched community individuals. We recruited across two distinct periods: Oct 14, 2021, to March 10, 2022 (12-17 months after vaccination), and Nov 21, 2022, to Oct 18, 2023 (24-36 months after vaccination). Study staff administered structured questionnaires to all participants to capture demographics, household conditions, potential confounding variables, and vaccination status. The odds of vaccination for the case and control groups were contrasted in conditional logistic regression models to estimate unadjusted and adjusted vaccine effectiveness.<h4>Findings</h4>We enrolled 658 individuals with confirmed cholera and 2274 matched individuals for the control group. 99 (15·1%) individuals in the case group were younger than 5 years at the time of vaccination. The adjusted single-dose vaccine effectiveness was 52·7% (95% CI 31·4 to 67·4) 12-17 months after vaccination and 44·7% (24·8 to 59·4) 24-36 months after vaccination. Although protection in the first 12-17 months after vaccination was similar for children aged 1-4 years and older individuals, the estimate of protection in children aged 1-4 years appeared to wane during the third year after vaccination (adjusted vaccine effectiveness 32·9%, 95% CI -30·7 to 65·5), with CIs spanning the null.<h4>Interpretation</h4>A single dose of Euvichol-Plus provided substantial protection against medically attended cholera for at least 36 months after vaccination in this cholera-endemic setting. Although the evidence provides support for similar levels of protection in young children and others in the short term, protection among children younger than 5 years might wane significantly during the third year after vaccination.<h4>Funding</h4>Wellcome Trust and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its enablers shape community uptake of non-covid vaccines such as the oral cholera vaccine (OCV) in the post-COVID-19 era. This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its drivers on OCV hesitancy in a cholera-endemic region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We conducted a community-based survey in Bukavu. The survey included demographics, intention to take OCV and COVID-19 vaccines, reasons for COVID-19 hesitancy, and thoughts and feelings about COVID-19 vaccines. Poisson regression analyses were performed. Of the 1708 respondents, 84.66% and 77.57% were hesitant to OCV alone and to both OCV and COVID-19, respectively. Hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccines rose OCV hesitancy by 12% (crude prevalence ratio, [cPR] = 1.12, 95%CI [1.03-1.21]). Independent predictors of OCV hesitancy were living in a semi-urban area (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.10, 95%CI [1.03-1.12]), religious refusal of vaccines (aPR = 1.06, 95%CI [1.02-1.12]), concerns about vaccine safety (aPR = 1.05, 95%CI [1.01-1.11]) and adverse effects (aPR = 1.06, 95%CI [1.01-1.12]), as well as poor vaccine literacy (aPR = 1.07, 95%CI [1.01-1.14]). Interestingly, the belief in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness reduced OCV hesitancy by 24% (aPR = 0.76, 95%CI [0.62-0.93]). COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its drivers exhibited a significant domino effect on OCV uptake. Addressing vaccine hesitancy through community-based health literacy and trust-building interventions would likely improve the introduction of novel non-COVID-19 vaccines in the post-COVID-19 era.",

      "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis infections are an important sexually transmitted infection that can lead to inflammation, scarring and hydrosalpinx/infertility. However, infections are commonly clinically asymptomatic and do not receive treatment. The underlying cause of asymptomatic immunopathology remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that IgG produced during male infection enhanced the incidence of immunopathology and infertility in females. Human endocervical cells expressing the neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn) increased translocation of human IgG-opsonized C. trachomatis. Using total IgG purified from infected male mice, we opsonized C. muridarum and then infected female mice, mimicking sexual transmission. Following infection, IgG-opsonized Chlamydia was found to transcytose the epithelial barrier in the uterus, where it was phagocytosed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and trafficked to the draining lymph nodes. APCs then expanded both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations and caused significantly more infertility in female mice infected with non-opsonized Chlamydia. Enhanced phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized Chlamydia significantly increased pro-inflammatory signalling and T cell proliferation. As IgG is transcytosed by FcRn, we utilized FcRn<sup>-/-</sup> mice and observed that shedding kinetics of Chlamydia were only affected in FcRn<sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with IgG-opsonized Chlamydia. Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in FcRn<sup>-/-</sup> mice lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of infertility. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IgG seroconversion during male infection can amplify female immunopathology, dependent on FcRn transcytosis, APC differentiation and enhanced CD8 T cell responses.",

      "abstract": "Urogenital chlamydial infections continue to increase with over 127 million people affected annually, causing significant economic and public health pressures. While the role of traditional MHCI and II peptide presentation is well defined in chlamydial infections, the role of lipid antigens in immunity remains unclear. Natural killer (NK) T cells are important effector cells that recognize and respond to lipid antigens during infections. Chlamydial infection of antigen-presenting cells facilitates presentation of lipid on the MHCI-like protein, CD1d, which stimulates NKT cells to respond. During urogenital chlamydial infection, wild-type (WT) female mice had significantly greater chlamydial burden than CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> (NKT-deficient) mice, and had significantly greater incidence and severity of immunopathology in both primary and secondary infections. WT mice had similar vaginal lymphocytic infiltrate, but 59% more oviduct occlusion compared to CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Transcriptional array analysis of oviducts day 6 post-infection revealed WT mice had elevated levels of Ifnγ (6-fold), Tnfα (38-fold), Il6 (2.5-fold), Il1β (3-fold) and Il17a (6-fold) mRNA compared to CD1d<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In infected females, oviduct tissues had an elevated infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> -invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, however, iNKT-deficient Jα18<sup>-/-</sup> mice had no significant differences in hydrosalpinx severity or incidence compared to WT controls. Lipid mass spectrometry of surface-cleaved CD1d in infected macrophages revealed an enhancement of presented lipids and cellular sequestration of sphingomyelin. Taken together, these data suggest an immunopathogenic role for non-invariant NKT cells in urogenital chlamydial infections, facilitated by lipid presentation via CD1d via infected antigen-presenting cells.",

      "abstract": "Chlamydia pneumoniae is a respiratory tract pathogen but can also infect the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, the link between C. pneumoniae CNS infection and late-onset dementia has become increasingly evident. In mice, CNS infection has been shown to occur weeks to months after intranasal inoculation. By isolating live C. pneumoniae from tissues and using immunohistochemistry, we show that C. pneumoniae can infect the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, olfactory bulb and brain within 72 h in mice. C. pneumoniae infection also resulted in dysregulation of key pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis at 7 and 28 days after inoculation. Interestingly, amyloid beta accumulations were also detected adjacent to the C. pneumoniae inclusions in the olfactory system. Furthermore, injury to the nasal epithelium resulted in increased peripheral nerve and olfactory bulb infection, but did not alter general CNS infection. In vitro, C. pneumoniae was able to infect peripheral nerve and CNS glia. In summary, the nerves extending between the nasal cavity and the brain constitute invasion paths by which C. pneumoniae can rapidly invade the CNS likely by surviving in glia and leading to Aβ deposition.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>ZAP-70<sup>W163C</sup> BALB/c (SKG) mice develop reactive arthritis (ReA) following infection with Chlamydia muridarum. Since intracellular pathogens enhance their replicative fitness in stressed host cells, we examined how myeloid cells infected with C muridarum drive arthritis.<h4>Methods</h4>SKG, Il17a-deficient SKG, and BALB/c female mice were infected with C muridarum or C muridarum luciferase in the genitals. C muridarum dissemination was assessed by in vivo imaging or genomic DNA amplification. Macrophages were depleted using clodronate liposomes. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and anti-interleukin-23p19 (anti-IL-23p19) were administered after infection or arthritis onset. Gene expression of Hspa5, Tgtp1, Il23a, Il17a, Il12b, and Tnf was compared in SKG mice and BALB/c mice.<h4>Results</h4>One week following infection with C muridarum, macrophages and neutrophils were observed to have infiltrated the uteri of mice and were also shown to have carried C muridarum DNA to the spleen. C muridarum load was higher in SKG mice than in BALB/c mice. Macrophage depletion was shown to reduce C muridarum load and prevent development of arthritis. Compared with BALB/c mice, expression of Il23a and Il17a was increased in the uterine and splenic neutrophils of SKG mice. The presence of anti-IL-23p19 during infection or Il17a deficiency suppressed arthritis. Tnf was overexpressed in the joints of SKG mice within 1 week postinfection, and persisted beyond the first week. TNF inhibition during infection or at arthritis onset suppressed the development of arthritis. Levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress were constitutively increased in the joints of SKG mice but were induced, in conjunction with immunity-related GTPase, by C muridarum infection in the uterus.<h4>Conclusion</h4>C muridarum load is higher in SKG mice than in BALB/c mice. Whereas proinflammatory IL-23 produced by neutrophils contributes to the initiation of C muridarum-mediated ReA, macrophage depletion reduces C muridarum dissemination to other tissues, tissue burden, and the development of arthritis. TNF inhibition was also shown to suppress arthritis development. Our data suggest that enhanced bacterial dissemination in macrophages of SKG mice drives the TNF production needed for persistent arthritis.",

To date, EMVI has funded approximately ten vaccine formulations (antigen-adjuvant combination) by developing GMP materials and sponsoring subsequent human clinical trials. In recent years EMVI's role has expanded into harmonization activities relevant to malaria vaccine development as well as making contributions to global coordination efforts in the field of malaria vaccine research and development (R&D). In the next five years, EMVI will be coordinating the European Network of Vaccine Research and Development, an European Commission supported action implementing a vaccine development infrastructure for Europe. By stimulating collaboration, cooperation, networking and joint integrated activities across various fields of research and diseases, and by facilitating the federation of research infrastructures, EMVI is acting today as a catalyst for tomorrow's vaccines.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>To develop and psychometrically evaluate an audio digitised tool for assessment of comprehension of informed consent among low-literacy Gambian research participants.<h4>Setting</h4>We conducted this study in the Gambia where a high illiteracy rate and absence of standardised writing formats of local languages pose major challenges for research participants to comprehend consent information. We developed a 34-item questionnaire to assess participants' comprehension of key elements of informed consent. The questionnaire was face validated and content validated by experienced researchers. To bypass the challenge of a lack of standardised writing formats, we audiorecorded the questionnaire in three major Gambian languages: Mandinka, Wolof and Fula. The questionnaire was further developed into an audio computer-assisted interview format.<h4>Participants</h4>The digitised questionnaire was administered to 250 participants enrolled in two clinical trials in the urban and rural areas of the Gambia. One week after first administration, the questionnaire was readministered to half of the participants who were randomly selected. Participants were eligible if enrolled in the parent trials and could speak any of the three major Gambian languages.<h4>Outcome measure</h4>The primary outcome measure was reliability and validity of the questionnaire.<h4>Results</h4>Item reduction by factor analysis showed that 21 of the question items have strong factor loadings. These were retained along with five other items which were fundamental components of informed consent. The 26-item questionnaire has high internal consistency with a Cronbach's α of 0.73-0.79 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.94 (95% CI 0.923 to 0.954). Hypotheses testing also showed that the questionnaire has a positive correlation with a similar questionnaire and discriminates between participants with and without education.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have developed a reliable and valid measure of comprehension of informed consent information for the Gambian context, which might be easily adapted to similar settings. This is a major step towards engendering comprehension of informed consent information among low-literacy participants.",

      "abstract": "Since 2000, under the Fifth and subsequent Framework Programmes, the European Commission has funded research to spur the development of a malaria vaccine. This funding has contributed to the promotion of an integrated infrastructure consisting of European basic, applied and clinical scientists in academia and small and medium enterprises, together with partners in Africa. Research has added basic understanding of what is required of a malaria vaccine, allowing selected candidates to be prioritized and some to be moved forward into clinical trials. To end the health burden of malaria, and its economic and social impact on development, the international community has now essentially committed itself to the eventual eradication of malaria. Given the current tentative advances towards elimination or eradication of malaria in many endemic areas, malaria vaccines constitute an additional and almost certainly essential component of any strategic plan to interrupt transmission of malaria. However, funding for malaria vaccines has been substantially reduced in the Seventh Framework Programme compared with earlier Framework Programmes, and without further support the gains made by earlier European investment will be lost.",

      "abstract": "For over 10 years, the European Vaccine Initiative (EVI; European Malaria Vaccine Initiative until 2009) has contributed to the development of 24 malaria candidate vaccine antigens with 13 vaccine candidates being advanced into Phase I clinical trials, two of which have been transitioned for further clinical development in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception the EVI organization has operated as a funding agency, but with a clear service-oriented strategy. The scientific successes and difficulties encountered during these years and how these efforts have led to standardization and harmonization in vaccine development through large-scale European consortia are discussed. In the future, the EVI will remain instrumental in the pharmaceutical and clinical development of vaccines against 'diseases of poverty' with a continued focus on malaria. EVI will continue to focus on funding and managing preclinical evaluation up to Phase I/II clinical trials and strengthening the vaccine-development infrastructure in Europe, albeit with a global orientation.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Though observational evidence supports indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, randomised experiments are lacking. To address this gap, the double-blinded, prospective follow-up of the household contacts (HHCs) of Philippine participants of the individually-randomised, placebo-controlled trial of the adjuvanted-subunit protein COVID-19 vaccine, SCB-2019, (EudraCT, 2020-004272-17; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04672395) was analyzed in a cluster-randomised fashion.<h4>Methods</h4>Over an eight-week period, HHCs were followed by rRT-PCR and paired rapid antibody tests (RATs) to detect symptomatic (SCI, primary) and all (ACI, secondary) SARS-CoV-2 infection. A standard analysis estimated the indirect effectiveness of SCB-2019 for each endpoint, excluding HHC RAT-positive at enrollment. A secondary analysis employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results to correct for suspected bias.<h4>Findings</h4>SCB-2019 (N = 3470) and placebo (N = 3225) exposed HHCs contributed to at least one analysis. The standard analysis estimated that SCB-2019 reduced the risk of SCI by 83% (95% confidence/credible interval [CI: 32% to 96%), with no effect against ACI. The bias-corrected relative risk reduction was 97% (95% CI: 74% to 100%) for SCI and 79% (95% CI: 14% to 96%) for ACI, with an estimated one SARS-CoV-2 infection prevented per 4.8 households where one member received SCB-2019.<h4>Interpretation</h4>SCB-2019 demonstrated bias-corrected indirect effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection among HHC, even at a modest coverage level in the household (approximately 25%). Further research into the indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is needed to optimize the impact of limited doses in low and middle-income settings.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Latin America (Latam) has a tradition of large-scale vaccine trials. Because of fluctuating demand, many sites have downsized their infrastructure. Therefore, BMGF launched a clinical trial site-readiness initiative early in the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic including Latam countries between August and September 2020. This survey evaluated clinical development performance measures pre/post initiative (September 2022).<h4>Results</h4>20/21 prequalified sites participated in COVID-19 vaccine/drug development trials. 156 clinical trials (140 COVID-19 vaccine/drug trials) were initiated in the 2 years since prequalification, compared to 176 in the 5 years before. 33,428/37,810 participants were included in COVID-19 programs. The number of enrolled subjects/day across sites quadrupled from 15 (1-35) to 63 (5-300). The dropout rate was 6.8%. Study approval timelines were reduced from 60 (12-120) to 35 (5-90) days. Mean qualified staff was increased from 24 (6-80) to 88 (22-180).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Clinical trial sites across Latam were successfully prequalified to participate in COVID-19 developments. For the 100 days mission of vaccine availability in a new pandemic sufficient and well-trained clinical trial sites readily available are essential. This is only achievable if sites-especially in low/middle-income countries-are maintained active through a constant flow of vaccine studies.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic is over but the highly immunized or naturally exposed global population still requires booster vaccinations against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We assessed safety and immunogenicity of booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines based on three different platforms in a setting that mimics the current routine practice in Brazil.<h4>Methods</h4>In this phase 3 study from 14 February 2023 to 12 June 2023 we enrolled previously immunized adults to receive an additional booster dose of one of three vaccines. Immunogenicity against ancestor SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron BF.7, BQ.1.1.3, and XBB.1.5.6 sub-lineages was measured as ELISA IgG or virus neutralizing (VNT) antibodies and safety/reactogenicity assessed using diary cards.<h4>Results</h4>Volunteers with a history of full primary COVID-19 immunization striated to three cohorts according to their previous booster vaccination history-0 (n = 26), 1 (n = 140) or 2 (n = 606) booster vaccinations-were randomized 2:1:1 to receive either recombinant protein (SCB-2019, Clover), adenovirus-vector (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca/Fiocruz), or mRNA (BNT162b2, Pfizer/Wyeth). Baseline antibody titers were higher in individuals who had received one or two boosters and titers against both ancestor and Omicron sub-lineages increased in all groups regardless of the number of previous booster doses or the vaccine used. Day 28 geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean-fold rises (GMFR) against all variants were higher after BNT162b than SCB-2019 or ChAdOx1-S, but BNT162b groups displayed more rapid antibody waning at Day 84. Within cohorts each vaccine elicited similar GMFR against the different SARS-CoV-2 strains. All vaccines were well tolerated with similar solicited reactogenicity profiles.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Protein, adenovirus-vector or mRNA vaccine boosters were equally well tolerated and immunogenic against ancestor SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron sub-lineages in fully primed adults with 0-2 prior boosters. BNT162b induced the highest immune responses but also the most rapid waning of antibodies 3 months after vaccination.<h4>Clinical trial registration</h4>ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT05812586.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Worldwide, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination coverage of healthcare professionals (HCPs) is below 40%, but this data is not available for Brazil. We hypothesize that a high number of HCPs are not immune to pertussis in Brazil. Main objective was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-pertussis toxin (anti-PT IgG) among HCPs. Secondary objectives were to evaluate Tdap vaccination coverage, to assess predictive factors associated with anti-PT IgG, and to estimate the decay of anti-PT IgG and time to Tdap vaccination.<h4>Methods</h4>Observational cross-sectional serological study in 352 HCPs who worked at São Paulo Hospital - Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) in 2020, approved by UNIFESP Ethics Committee. Data collected included sociodemographics, knowledge about Tdap, and vaccination status. Anti-PT IgG were quantified by ELISA: <10 IU/mL seronegative and ≥ 10-1000 IU/mL seropositive. Titers ≥ 10-50 IU/mL were classified low positivity, indicating no recent B. pertussis infection or Tdap vaccination; >50 IU/mL high positivity, indicating recent B. pertussis infection or Tdap vaccination, and > 100 IU/mL as acute B. pertussis infection or Tdap vaccination in the previous year. Comparisons were done by Chi-square test, multivariable logistic regression, and Pearsońs correlation, at 5% p-level.<h4>Results</h4>331/352 HCPs were not aware the Brazilian National Immunization Program recommends Tdap for all HCPs and pregnant women. 68/339 HCPs received Tdap (mean 3.1 ± 2.0 years). 55/352 were seronegative for pertussis, all unvaccinated. 56/271 with no history of Tdap vaccination had high positivity. The probability of anti-PT IgG > 50 IU/mL was 11.5 times higher in Tdap vaccinated HCPs than in non-vaccinated (p < 0.001). There was a weak but significant correlation between anti-PT IgG and interval of Tdap vaccination (r = 0.404; p = 0.001). Anti-PT IgG dropped 5 IU/mL/year (p = 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Better education of HCPs on needs and benefits of Tdap vaccination is critical. Goals must be to improve HCPs vaccination coverage.",

In November 2020, nOPV2 became the first vaccine to be granted an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) Prequalification Team (PQT), allowing close to a billion doses to be used by countries within three years after its first rollout and leading to full licensure and WHO prequalification (PQ) in December 2023. The nOPV2 development process exemplifies how scientific advances and innovative tools can be applied to combat global health emergencies in an urgent and adaptive way, building on a collaborative effort among scientific, regulatory and implementation partners and policymakers across the globe.",

      "abstract": "Viral accessory proteins play critical roles in viral escape form host innate immune responses and in viral inflammatory pathogenesis. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein, ORF9b, but not other SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, ORF9c, ORF10), strongly activates inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 in A549 lung carcinoma cells and THP-1 monocyte-macrophage cells. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP additively enhanced the activation of caspase-1 by ORF9b, suggesting that ORF9b and LPS follow parallel pathways in the activation of the inflammasome and caspase-1. Following rational in silico approaches, we have designed small molecules capable of inhibiting the homodimerization of ORF9b, which experimentally inhibited ORF9b-ORF9b homotypic interactions, caused mitochondrial eviction of ORF9b, inhibited ORF9b-induced activation of caspase-1 in A549 and THP-1 cells, cytokine release in THP-1 cells, and restored type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling suppressed by ORF9b in both cell models. These small molecules are first-in-class compounds targeting a viral accessory protein critical for viral-induced exacerbated inflammation and escape from innate immune responses, with the potential of mitigating the severe immunopathogenic damage induced by highly pathogenic coronaviruses and restoring antiviral innate immune responses curtailed by viral infection.",

      "abstract": "Rapid and early detection of infectious diseases in pigs is important, especially for the implementation of control measures in suspected cases of African swine fever (ASF), as an effective and safe vaccine is not yet available in most of the affected countries. Additionally, analysis for swine influenza is of significance due to its high morbidity rate (up to 100%) despite a lower mortality rate compared to ASF. The wide distribution of swine influenza A virus (SwIAV) across various countries, the emergence of constantly new recombinant strains, and the danger of human infection underscore the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis. Several diagnostic approaches and commercial methods should be applied depending on the scenario, type of sample and the objective of the studies being implemented. At the early diagnosis of an outbreak, virus genome detection using a variety of PCR assays proves to be the most sensitive and specific technique. As the disease evolves, serology gains diagnostic value, as specific antibodies appear later in the course of the disease (after 7-10 days post-infection (DPI) for ASF and between 10-21 DPI for SwIAV). The ongoing development of commercial kits with enhanced sensitivity and specificity is evident. This review aims to analyse recent advances and current commercial kits utilised for the diagnosis of ASF and SwIAV.",

      "abstract": "Viral accessory proteins play critical roles in viral escape from host innate immune responses and in viral inflammatory pathogenesis. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein, ORF9b, but not other SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, ORF9c, and ORF10), strongly activates inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 in A549 lung carcinoma cells and THP-1 monocyte-macrophage cells. Exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP additively enhanced the activation of caspase-1 by ORF9b, suggesting that ORF9b and LPS follow parallel pathways in the activation of the inflammasome and caspase-1. Following rational in silico approaches, we have designed small molecules capable of inhibiting the homodimerization of ORF9b, which experimentally inhibited ORF9b-ORF9b homotypic interactions, caused mitochondrial eviction of ORF9b, inhibited ORF9b-induced activation of caspase-1 in A549 and THP-1 cells, cytokine release in THP-1 cells, and restored type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling suppressed by ORF9b in both cell models. These small molecules are first-in-class compounds targeting a viral accessory protein critical for viral-induced exacerbated inflammation and escape from innate immune responses, with the potential of mitigating the severe immunopathogenic damage induced by highly pathogenic coronaviruses and restoring antiviral innate immune responses curtailed by viral infection.",

      "abstract": "Due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance and new and more complex diseases that affect livestock animal health and food security, the control of epidemics has become a top priority worldwide. Vaccination represents the most important and cost-effective measure to control infectious diseases in animal health, but it represents only 23% of the total global animal health market, highlighting the need to develop new vaccines. A recent strategy in animal health vaccination is the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer nanovesicles produced by almost all living cells, including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. EVs have been evaluated as a prominent source of viral antigens to elicit specific immune responses and to develop new vaccination platforms as viruses and EVs share biogenesis pathways. Preliminary trials with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (LCMV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and Marek's disease virus (MDV) have demonstrated that EVs have a role in the activation of cellular and antibody immune responses. Moreover, in parasitic diseases such as <i>Eimeria</i> (chickens) and <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> (mice) protection has been achieved. Research into EVs is therefore opening an opportunity for new strategies to overcome old problems affecting food security, animal health, and emerging diseases. Here, we review different conventional approaches for vaccine design and compare them with examples of EV-based vaccines that have already been tested in relation to animal health.",

Also, their corresponding knock-out or knock-in derivatives have been the most commonly used animal systems in immunological studies. With much credit to their usefulness, laboratory mice will never provide all the answers to fully understand immunological processes. Large animal models offer unique biological and experimental advantages that have been and continue to be of great value to the understanding of biological and immunological processes. From the identification of B cells to the realization that γδ T cells can function as professional antigen presenting cells, farm animals have contributed significantly to a better understanding of immunity.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Carbapenemase-producing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (CPE) pose a considerable threat to modern medicine. New treatment options and methods to limit spread need to be investigated. Blue light (BL) is intrinsically antimicrobial, and we have previously demonstrated significant antimicrobial effects on biofilms of a panel of isolates, including two CPEs.This study was performed to assess the antibacterial activity of 405 nm BL against a panel of CPE isolates (four encoding <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub>, three <i>bla</i><sub>KPC</sub>, two <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub>, and three encoding both NDM and OXA-48 carbapenemases).<h4>Methods</h4>In vitro experiments were conducted on 72 h old biofilms of CPEs which were exposed to 60 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> of BL. Changes to biofilm seeding were assessed by measuring the optical density of treated and untreated biofilms.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve bacterial clinical isolates (comprising eight <i>Klebsiella pnemoniae</i>, one <i>K. oxytoca</i>, and three <i>Escherichia coli</i>) were tested. BL was delivered for 5, 15 and 30 min, achieving doses of 162, 54, and 108 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.All of the CPEs were susceptible to BL treatment, with increasing reductions in seeding with increasing durations of exposure. At 30 min, reductions in biofilm seeding of ≥80% were observed for 11 of the 12 isolates, compared to five of 12 after 15 min. CPE_8180 was less susceptible than the rest, with a maximum reduction in seeding of 66% at 30 min.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BL is effective at reducing the seeding of mature CPE biofilms in vitro, and offers great promise as a topical decontamination/treatment agent for both clinical and environmental applications.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>We previously reported on the ability of SurgihoneyRO (SHRO), an engineered honey, to prevent biofilm formation in vitro, but data were lacking regarding the activity against preformed biofilms. This study aims to assess whether SHRO has any antibacterial activity against mature, preformed biofilms and whether there is any evidence to support the observed clinical effectiveness when SHRO has been used anecdotally on acute and chronic wounds where biofilm is most likely present.<h4>Method</h4>We tested the in vitro antibacterial activity of SHRO against the mature biofilms of 16 clinically relevant wound pathogens, in terms of impacts on biofilm seeding and biofilm biomass. The honey was serially double diluted from 1:3 down to 1:6144, and the lowest dilution achieving a statistically significant reduction in biomass of ≥50%, compared with untreated controls, was recorded.<h4>Results</h4>All 16 bacterial isolates were susceptible to SHRO, with reduced biofilm seeding observed for all, and percentage reductions ranging from 58% (ACI_C59) to 94.3% (MDR_B) for the strongest concentration of honey (1:3). Furthermore at this concentration, biofilm seeding of the test biofilm was reduced by 80-94.3% (when compared with the positive control) for 12/16 isolates. We additionally demonstrated that SHRO has antibiofilm impacts, with the 24 hour exposure resulting in disruption of the biofilm, reduced seeding and reduced biomass.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SHRO is effective at reducing seeding of preformed biofilms of clinically important wound pathogens in vitro, and also has antibiofilm activity. This supports the anecdotal clinical data for antibiofilm efficacy, and supports the use of SHRO as a promising topical wound care agent.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The early diagnosis of infection or sepsis in burns are important for patient care. Globally, a large number of burn centres advocate quantitative cultures of wound biopsies for patient management, since there is assumed to be a direct link between the bioburden of a burn wound and the risk of microbial invasion. Given the conflicting study findings in this area, a systematic review was warranted.<h4>Methods</h4>Bibliographic databases were searched with no language restrictions to August 2015. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate using pre-defined criteria. Substantial heterogeneity precluded quantitative synthesis, and findings were described narratively, sub-grouped by clinical question.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty six laboratory and/or clinical studies were included. Substantial heterogeneity hampered comparisons across studies and interpretation of findings. Limited evidence suggests that (i) more than one quantitative microbiology sample is required to obtain reliable estimates of bacterial load; (ii) biopsies are more sensitive than swabs in diagnosing or predicting sepsis; (iii) high bacterial loads may predict worse clinical outcomes, and (iv) both quantitative and semi-quantitative culture reports need to be interpreted with caution and in the context of other clinical risk factors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The evidence base for the utility and reliability of quantitative microbiology for diagnosing or predicting clinical outcomes in burns patients is limited and often poorly reported. Consequently future research is warranted.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>The blue wavelengths within the visible light spectrum are intrinisically antimicrobial and can photodynamically inactivate the cells of a wide spectrum of bacteria (Gram positive and negative) and fungi. Furthermore, blue light is equally effective against both drug-sensitive and -resistant members of target species and is less detrimental to mammalian cells than is UV radiation. Blue light is currently used for treating acnes vulgaris and Helicobacter pylori infections; the utility for decontamination and treatment of wound infections is in its infancy. Furthermore, limited studies have been performed on bacterial biofilms, the key growth mode of bacteria involved in clinical infections. Here we report the findings of a multicenter in vitro study performed to assess the antimicrobial activity of 400-nm blue light against bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm growth modes. Blue light was tested against a panel of 34 bacterial isolates (clinical and type strains) comprising Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Elizabethkingia meningoseptica All planktonic-phase bacteria were susceptible to blue light treatment, with the majority (71%) demonstrating a ≥5-log10 decrease in viability after 15 to 30 min of exposure (54 J/cm(2) to 108 J/cm(2)). Bacterial biofilms were also highly susceptible to blue light, with significant reduction in seeding observed for all isolates at all levels of exposure. These results warrant further investigation of blue light as a novel decontamination strategy for the nosocomial environment, as well as additional wider decontamination applications.<h4>Importance</h4>Blue light shows great promise as a novel decontamination strategy for the nosocomial environment, as well as additional wider decontamination applications (e.g., wound closure during surgery). This warrants further investigation.",

      "title": "Protocol for a systematic review of quantitative burn wound microbiology in the management of burns patients.",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Sepsis from burn injuries can result from colonisation of burn wounds, especially in large surface area burns. Reducing bacterial infection will reduce morbidity and mortality, and mortality for severe burns can be as high as 15 %. There are various quantitative and semi-quantitative techniques to monitor bacterial load on wounds. In the UK, burn wounds are typically monitored for the presence or absence of bacteria through the collection and culture of swabs, but no absolute count is obtained. Quantitative burn wound culture provides a measure of bacterial count and is gaining increased popularity in some countries. It is however more resource intensive, and evidence for its utility appears to be inconsistent. This systematic review therefore aims to assess the evidence on the utility and reliability of different quantitative microbiology techniques in terms of diagnosing or predicting clinical outcomes.<h4>Methods/design</h4>Standard systematic review methods aimed at minimising bias will be employed for study identification, selection and data extraction. Bibliographic databases and ongoing trial registers will be searched and conference abstracts screened. Studies will be eligible if they are prospective studies or systematic reviews of burn patients (any age) for whom quantitative microbiology has been performed, whether it is compared to another method. Quality assessment will be based on quality assessment tools for diagnostic and prognostic studies and tailored to the review as necessary. Synthesis is likely to be primarily narrative, but meta-analysis may be considered where clinical and methodological homogeneity exists.<h4>Discussion</h4>Given the increasing use of quantitative methods, this is a timely systematic review, which will attempt to clarify the evidence base. As far as the authors are aware, it will be the first to address this topic.<h4>Trial registration</h4>PROSPERO, CRD42015023903.",

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the gold standard treatment for hypertension. Recently, several studies highlighted the crucial role of immune system in hypertension. Angiotensin-II-induced hypertension is associated with low grade inflammation characterized by innate and adaptive immune system dysfunction. Throughout the progression of hypertension, monocyte/macrophage cells appear to have a crucial role in vascular inflammation and interaction with the arterial wall. Since myelomonocytic cells potentially play a key role in angiotensin-II-induced hypertension and organ damage, pharmacological targeting of RAS components in monocyte/macrophages may possibly present an innovative strategy for treatment of hypertension and related pathology.",

      "abstract": "Inhibiting pathological secretion of Interleukin-1β has shown beneficial effects in disease models and in the clinic and thus there is interest in finding inhibitors that can reduce its release from macrophages in response to their activation by foreign pathogens. We used an in vitro human macrophage model to investigate whether ICRF-193, a Topoisomerase II inhibitor could modulate IL1B mRNA expression and IL-1β secretion. These macrophage-like cells readily secrete IL-1β in response to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upon exposure to a non-toxic dose of ICRF-193, IL-1β secretion was diminished by ~ 40%; however, level of transcription of IL1B was unaffected. We show that there was no Topoisomerase 2B (TOP2B) binding to several IL1B gene sites, which may explain why ICRF-193 does not alter IL1B mRNA levels. Hence, we show for the first time that ICRF-193 can reduce IL-1β secretion. Its low cost and the development of water-soluble prodrugs of ICRF-193 warrants its further investigation in the modulation of pathological secretion of this cytokine for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

      "abstract": "Inhibiting pathological secretion of Interleukin-1β has shown beneficial effects in disease models and in the clinic and thus there is interest in finding inhibitors that can reduce its release from macrophages in response to their activation by foreign pathogens. We used an in vitro human macrophage model to investigate whether ICRF-193, a Topoisomerase II inhibitor could modulate IL1B mRNA expression and IL-1β secretion. These macrophage-like cells readily secrete IL-1β in response to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upon exposure to a non-toxic dose of ICRF-193, IL-1β secretion was diminished by ~ 40%; however, level of transcription of IL1B was unaffected. We show that there was no Topoisomerase 2B (TOP2B) binding to IL1B gene proximal sites, confirming that it is not involved directly in mediating the transcription of IL1B and hence why ICRF-193 does not alter IL1B mRNA levels. Quantification of Topoisomerase isoforms suggests that TOP2B plays a role in mediating the effects of ICRF-193 on IL-1β secretion. Hence, we show for the first time that ICRF-193 can reduce IL-1β secretion. Its low cost and the development of water-soluble prodrugs of ICRF-193 warrants its further investigation in the modulation of pathological secretion of this cytokine for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

      "abstract": "Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules are a major risk factor for rejection of transplanted organs (in antibody-mediated rejection [ABMR]), particularly in patients who have prior sensitization or receive insufficient immunosuppression through minimization or noncompliance. These DSA are measured routinely in the serum of patients prior to transplantation mainly using bead-based technologies or cell-based assays. However, the absence of detectable serum DSA does not always reflect the absence of sensitization or histologically defined ABMR, and so it has been proposed that the detection and measurement of memory B cells capable of secreting antibodies against donor HLA antigens could be carried out using B-cell ImmunoSpot, to better inform the degree of immune sensitization of transplant patients prior to as well as after transplantation. Such an assay is described here.",

      "title": "Next generation organoid engineering to replace animals in cancer drug testing.",
      "abstract": "Cancer therapies have several clinical challenges associated with them, namely treatment toxicity, treatment resistance and relapse. Due to factors ranging from patient profiles to the tumour microenvironment (TME), there are several hurdles to overcome in developing effective treatments that have low toxicity that can mitigate emergence of resistance and occurrence of relapse. De novo cancer development has the highest drug attrition rates with only 1 in 10,000 preclinical candidates reaching the market. To alleviate this high attrition rate, more mimetic and sustainable preclinical models that can capture the disease biology as in the patient, are required. Organoids and next generation 3D tissue engineering is an emerging area that aims to address this problem. Advancement of three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cultures into complex organoid models incorporating multiple cell types alongside acellular aspects of tissue microenvironments can provide a system for therapeutic testing. Development of microfluidic technologies have furthermore increased the biomimetic nature of these models. Additionally, 3D bio-printing facilitates generation of tractable ex vivo models in a controlled, scalable and reproducible manner. In this review we highlight some of the traditional preclinical models used in cancer drug testing and debate how next generation organoids are being used to replace not only animal models, but also some of the more elementary in vitro approaches, such as cell lines. Examples of applications of the various models will be appraised alongside the future challenges that still need to be overcome.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal helminth parasites (worms) have afflicted humans throughout history and their eggs are readily detected in archaeological deposits including at locations where intestinal parasites are no longer considered endemic (e.g. the UK). Parasites provide valuable archaeological insights into historical health, sanitation, hygiene, dietary and culinary practices, as well as other factors. Differences in the prevalence of helminths over time may help us understand factors that affected the rate of infection of these parasites in past populations. While communal deposits often contain relatively high numbers of parasite eggs, these cannot be used to calculate prevalence rates, which are a key epidemiological measure of infection. The prevalence of intestinal helminths was investigated through time in England, based on analysis of 464 human burials from 17 sites, dating from the Prehistoric to Industrial periods. Eggs from two faecal-oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris sp. and Trichuris sp.) and the food-derived cestodes (Taenia spp. and Diphyllobothrium latum syn Dibothriocephalus latus) were identified, although only Ascaris was detected at a high frequency. The changing prevalence of nematode infections can be attributed to changes in effective sanitation or other factors that affect these faecal-oral transmitted parasites and the presence of cestode infections reflect dietary and culinary preferences. These results indicate that the impact of helminth infections on past populations varied over time, and that some locations witnessed a dramatic reduction in parasite prevalence during the industrial era (18th-19th century), whereas other locations continued to experience high prevalence levels. The factors underlying these reductions and the variation in prevalence provide a key historical context for modern anthelmintic programs.",

      "abstract": "The ability of zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) to recognize and respond to RNA virus sequences with elevated frequencies of CpG dinucleotides has been proposed as a functional part of the vertebrate innate immune antiviral response. It has been further proposed that ZAP activity shapes compositions of cytoplasmic mRNA sequences to avoid self-recognition, particularly mRNAs for interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expressed during the antiviral state. We investigated whether restriction of the replication of mutants of influenza A virus (IAV) and the echovirus 7 (E7) replicon with high CpG and UpA frequencies varied in different species of mammals and birds. Cell lines from different bird orders showed substantial variability in restriction of CpG-high mutants of IAV and E7 replicons, whereas none restricted UpA-high mutants, in marked contrast to universal restriction of both mutants in mammalian cells. Dinucleotide representation in ISGs and IFN genes was compared with those of cellular transcriptomes to determine whether potential differences in inferred ZAP activity between species shaped dinucleotide compositions of highly expressed genes during the antiviral state. While mammalian type 1 IFN genes typically showed often profound suppression of CpG and UpA frequencies, there was no oversuppression of either in ISGs in any species, irrespective of their ability to restrict CpG- or UpA-high mutants. Similarly, genome sequences of mammalian and avian RNA viruses were compositionally equivalent, as were IAV strains recovered from ducks, chickens and humans. Overall, we found no evidence for host variability in inferred ZAP function shaping host or viral transcriptome compositions.",

      "abstract": "Wild-living animals are subject to weather variability that may cause the generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in oxidative stress and tissue damage, potentially driving demographic responses. Our 3-yr field study investigated the effects of seasonal weather conditions on biomarkers for oxidative stress, oxidative damage, and antioxidant defense in the European badger (Meles meles). We found age class effects: cubs were more susceptible to oxidative stress and oxidative damage than adults, especially very young cubs in the spring, when they also exhibited lower antioxidant biomarkers than adults. Although previous studies have found that intermediate spring and summer rainfall and warmer temperatures favor cub survival, counterintuitively these conditions were associated with more severe oxidative damage. Oxidative damage was high in cubs even when antioxidant biomarkers were high. In contrast, adult responses accorded with previous survival analyses. Wetter spring and summer conditions were associated with higher oxidative damage, but they were also associated with higher antioxidant biomarkers. Autumnal weather did not vary substantially from normative values, and thus effects were muted. Winter carryover effects were partially evident, with drier and milder conditions associated with greater oxidative damage in the following spring but also with higher antioxidant capacity. Plausibly, warmer conditions promoted more badger activity, with associated metabolic costs at a time of year when food supply is limited. Modeling biomarkers against projected climate change scenarios predicted greater future risks of oxidative damage, although not necessarily exceeding antioxidant capacity. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates that individual adaptive physiological responses are associated with variation in natural environmental conditions.",

      "abstract": "Circoviruses infect a variety of animal species and have small (~1.8-2.2 kb) circular single-stranded DNA genomes. Recently a penguin circovirus (PenCV) was identified associated with an Adélie Penguin (<i>Pygoscelis adeliae</i>) with feather disorder and in the cloacal swabs of three asymptomatic Adélie Penguins at Cape Crozier, Antarctica. A total of 75 cloacal swab samples obtained from adults and chicks of three species of penguin (genus: <i>Pygoscelis</i>) from seven Antarctic breeding colonies (South Shetland Islands and Western Antarctic Peninsula) in the 2015-2016 breeding season were screened for PenCV. We identified new variants of PenCV in one Adélie Penguin and one Chinstrap Penguin (<i>Pygoscelis antarcticus</i>) from Port Charcot, Booth Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, a site home to all three species of Pygoscelid penguins. These two PenCV genomes (length of 1986 nucleotides) share > 99% genome-wide nucleotide identity with each other and share ~87% genome-wide nucleotide identity with the PenCV sequences described from Adélie Penguins at Cape Crozier ~4400 km away in East Antarctica. We did not find any evidence of recombination among PenCV sequences. This is the first report of PenCV in Chinstrap Penguins and the first detection outside of Ross Island, East Antarctica. Given the limited knowledge on Antarctic animal viral diversity, future samples from Antarctic wildlife should be screened for these and other viruses to determine the prevalence and potential impact of viral infections.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have been jumping between non-human primates in West/Central Africa for thousands of years and yet, the HIV-1 epidemic only originated from a primate lentivirus over 100 years ago.<h4>Methods</h4>This study examined the replicative fitness, transmission, restriction, and cytopathogenicity of 22 primate lentiviruses in primary human lymphoid tissue and both primary human and chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells.<h4>Findings</h4>Pairwise competitions revealed that SIV from chimpanzees (cpz) had the highest replicative fitness in human or chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even higher fitness than HIV-1 group M strains responsible for worldwide epidemic. The SIV strains belonging to the \"HIV-2 lineage\" (including SIVsmm, SIVmac, SIVagm) had the lowest replicative fitness. SIVcpz strains were less inhibited by human restriction factors than the \"HIV-2 lineage\" strains. SIVcpz efficiently replicated in human tonsillar tissue but did not deplete CD4+ T-cells, consistent with the slow or nonpathogenic disease observed in most chimpanzees. In contrast, HIV-1 isolates and SIV of the HIV-2 lineage were pathogenic to the human tonsillar tissue, almost independent of the level of virus replication.<h4>Interpretation</h4>Of all primate lentiviruses, SIV from chimpanzees appears most capable of infecting and replicating in humans, establishing HIV-1. SIV from other Old World monkeys, e.g. the progenitor of HIV-2, replicate slowly in humans due in part to restriction factors. Nonetheless, many of these SIV strains were more pathogenic than SIVcpz. Either SIVcpz evolved into a more pathogenic virus while in humans or a rare SIVcpz, possibly extinct in chimpanzees, was pathogenic immediately following the jump into human.<h4>Funding</h4>Support for this study to E.J.A. was provided by the NIH/NIAID R01 AI49170 and CIHR project grant 385787. Infrastructure support was provided by the NIH CFAR AI36219 and Canadian CFI/Ontario ORF 36287. Efforts of J.A.B. and N.J.H. was provided by NIH AI099473 and for D.H.C., by VA and NIH AI AI080313.",

      "abstract": "Most patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome characterized by severe hypoxemia, decreased lung compliance, and high vascular permeability. Activation of the complement system is a hallmark of moderate and severe COVID-19, with abundant deposition of complement proteins in inflamed tissue and on the endothelium during COVID-19. Using a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the therapeutic utility of an inhibitory antibody (HG4) targeting MASP-2, a key enzyme in the lectin pathway. Treatment of infected mice with HG4 reduced the disease severity score and improved survival vs mice that received an isotype control antibody. Administration of HG4 significantly reduced the lung injury score, including alveolar inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar edema, and alveolar hemorrhage. The ameliorating effect of MASP-2 inhibition on the severity of COVID-19 pathology is reflected by a significant reduction in the proinflammatory activation of brain microglia in HG4-treated mice.",

      "abstract": "Safe and effective vaccines have been regarded early on as critical in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the deployed vaccine platforms, subunit vaccines have a particularly good safety profile but may suffer from a lower immunogenicity compared to mRNA based or viral vector vaccines. In fact, this phenomenon has also been observed for SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines comprising the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Therefore, RBD-based vaccines have to rely on additional measures to enhance the immune response. It is well accepted that displaying antigens on nanoparticles can improve the quantity and quality of vaccine-mediated both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Based on this, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 RBD as immunogen would benefit from being presented to the immune system via silica nanoparticles (SiNPs). Herein we describe the preparation, in vitro characterization, antigenicity and in vivo immunogenicity of SiNPs decorated with properly oriented RBD in mice. We found our RBD-SiNP conjugates show narrow, homogeneous particle distribution with optimal size of about 100 nm for efficient transport to and into the lymph node. The colloidal stability and binding of the antigen was stable for at least 4 months at storage- and in vivo-temperatures. The antigenicity of the RBD was maintained upon binding to the SiNP surface, and the receptor-binding motif was readily accessible due to the spatial orientation of the RBD. The particles were efficiently taken up in vitro by antigen-presenting cells. In a mouse immunization study using an mRNA vaccine and spike protein as benchmarks, we found that the SiNP formulation was able to elicit a stronger RBD-specific humoral response compared to the soluble protein. For the adjuvanted RBD-SiNP we found strong S-specific multifunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, a balanced T helper response, improved auto- and heterologous virus neutralization capacity, and increased serum avidity, suggesting increased affinity maturation. In summary, our results provide further evidence for the possibility of optimizing the cellular and humoral immune response through antigen presentation on SiNP.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Vaccine breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron induced a higher level of protection compared to triple vaccination and contributed to herd immunity on a population level. To address the underlying immunological mechanisms, we studied the evolution of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and Tcell responses during vaccination and upon breakthrough infection in Bavarian residents between February 2021 and December 2022. Further, we investigated the temporal distance between completed vaccination and break-through infection, as well as any occurring re-infection. Each vaccination significantly increased peak neutralization titers against Wuhan, Delta, and Omicron BA.5 with simultaneous increases in circulating spike-specific Tcell frequencies. After vaccination, Omicron BA.5 neutralization titers were most significantly associated with a reduced hazard rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection, also when accounting for spikespecific Tcell responses. Yet, 97% of triple vaccinees became SARS-CoV-2 infected, often within a few months after their third vaccination. Breakthrough infections further boosted neutralization magnitude and breadth, broadened virusspecific Tcell responses to non-vaccine-encoded antigens and protected with an efficiency of 88% from further infections by December 2022. This effect was then assessed by utilizing mathematical modelling, which accounted for time-dependent infection risk in Bavaria, as well as the antibody and Tcell concentration at any time point after breakthrough infection. Our findings suggest that cross-variant protective hybrid immunity induced by vaccination and breakthrough infection was an important contributor to the reduced virus transmission observed in Bavaria in late 2022 and thereafter.</p>",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The virus neutralization assay is a principal method to assess the efficacy of antibodies in blocking viral entry. Due to biosafety handling requirements of viruses classified as hazard group 3 or 4, pseudotyped viruses can be used as a safer alternative. However, it is often queried how well the results derived from pseudotyped viruses correlate with authentic virus. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to comprehensively evaluate the correlation between the two assays.<h4>Methods</h4>Using PubMed and Google Scholar, reports that incorporated neutralisation assays with both pseudotyped virus, authentic virus, and the application of a mathematical formula to assess the relationship between the results, were selected for review. Our searches identified 67 reports, of which 22 underwent a three-level meta-analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The three-level meta-analysis revealed a high level of correlation between pseudotyped viruses and authentic viruses when used in an neutralisation assay. Reports that were not included in the meta-analysis also showed a high degree of correlation, with the exception of lentiviral-based pseudotyped Ebola viruses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pseudotyped viruses identified in this report can be used as a surrogate for authentic virus, though care must be taken in considering which pseudotype core to use when generating new uncharacterised pseudotyped viruses.",

      "abstract": "Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors (TLRs), play a crucial role in recognizing invading pathogens as well as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released in response to infection. The resulting signaling cascades initiate appropriate immune responses to eliminate these pathogens. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2-driven activation of TLR4, whether through direct recognition of the spike glycoprotein (alone or in combination with endotoxin) or by sensing various TLR4-activating DAMPs or alarmins released during viral infection, acts as a critical mediator of antiviral immunity. However, TLR4 exerts a dual role in COVID-19, demonstrating both beneficial and deleterious effects. Dysregulated TLR4 signaling is implicated in the proinflammatory consequences linked to the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. Additionally, TLR4 polymorphisms contribute to severity of the disease. Given its significant immunoregulatory impact on COVID-19 immunopathology and host immunity, TLR4 has emerged as a key target for developing inhibitors and immunotherapeutic strategies to mitigate the adverse effects associated with SARS-CoV-2 and related infections. Furthermore, TLR4 agonists are also being explored as adjuvants to enhance immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

      "title": "Comparative Analysis of the Aspergillus fumigatus Cell Wall Modification and Ensuing Human Dendritic Cell Responses by β-(1,3)-Glucan Synthase Inhibitors-Caspofungin and Enfumafungin.",
      "abstract": "Caspofungin, a lipopeptide, is an antifungal drug that belong to the class of echinocandin. It inhibits fungal cell wall β-(1,3)-glucan synthase activity and is the second-line of drug for invasive aspergillosis, a fatal infection caused mainly by Aspergillus fumigatus. On the other hand, Enfumafungin is a natural triterpene glycoside also with a β-(1,3)-glucan synthase inhibitory activity and reported to have antifungal potential. In the present study, we compared the growth as well as modifications in the A. fumigatus cell wall upon treatment with Caspofungin or Enfumafungin, consequentially their immunomodulatory capacity on human dendritic cells. Caspofungin initially inhibited the growth of A. fumigatus, but the effect was lost over time. By contrast, Enfumafungin inhibited this fungal growth for the duration investigated. Both Caspofungin and Enfumafungin caused a decrease in the cell wall β-(1,3)-glucan content with a compensatory increase in the chitin, and to a minor extent they also affected cell wall galactose content. Treatment with these two antifungals did not result in the exposure of β-(1,3)-glucan on A. fumigatus mycelial surface. Enzymatic digestion suggested a modification of β-(1,3)-glucan structure, specifically its branching, upon Enfumafungin treatment. While there was no difference in the immunostimulatory capacity of antifungal treated A. fumigatus conidia, alkali soluble-fractions from Caspofungin treated mycelia weakly stimulated the dendritic cells, possibly due to an increased content of immunosuppressive polysaccharide galactosaminogalactan. Overall, we demonstrate a novel mechanism that Enfumafungin not only inhibits β-(1,3)-glucan synthase activity, but also causes modifications in the structure of β-(1,3)-glucan in the A. fumigatus cell wall.",

      "title": "Emerging trends in the cystatin C sensing technologies: towards better chronic kidney disease management.",
      "abstract": "Cystatin C (CysC), a protein, has replaced creatinine as a biomarker of kidney function and other diseases and has led to a surge in the research on the development of efficient CysC biosensors. The current CysC sensing technologies are remarkable in terms of selectivity and reproducibility. However, the complexity, cost, and space requirements of these methods render them unsuitable for real-time monitoring or point-of-care (PoC) implementations in healthcare settings. This review discusses the most recent developments in the field of CysC biosensing and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first focused review exclusively on CysC biosensing modalities. Our goal is to provide a thorough overview of the current state of CysC biosensors, and presenting mechanisms related to biosensor recognition and transduction. The review starts with clinical significance of CysC detection followed by detailed analysis of different CysC biosensing methods with emphasis on the necessity of PoC monitoring of CysC. We have also highlighted current challenges and an outlook on future perspectives. We anticipate that this study will play a key role in the understanding the working principle of CysC sensors and will aid in the designing of new efficient sensing modalities for the detection of CysC.",

      "title": "Non-Ti MXenes: new biocompatible and biodegradable candidates for biomedical applications.",
      "abstract": "MXenes are a class of two-dimensional nanomaterials with the general formula M<sub><i>n</i>+1</sub>X<sub><i>n</i></sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>, where M denotes a transition metal, X denotes either carbon or nitrogen and T<sub><i>x</i></sub> refers to surface terminations, such as -OH, -O, -F or -Cl. The unique properties of MXenes, including their tunable surface chemistry and high surface area-to-volume ratio, make them promising candidates for various biomedical applications, such as targeted drug delivery, photothermal therapy and so on. Among the family of MXenes, titanium (Ti)-based MXenes, especially Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub>, have been extensively explored for biomedical applications. However, despite their potential, Ti-based MXenes have shown some limitations, such as low biocompatibility. Recent studies have also indicated that Ti MXenes may disrupt spermatogenesis and accumulate in the uterus. Non-Ti MXenes are emerging as promising alternatives to Ti-based MXenes due to their superior biodegradability and enhanced biocompatibility. Recently, non-Ti MXenes have been explored for a range of biomedical applications, including drug delivery, photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, some non-Ti MXenes exhibit enzyme-mimicking activity, such as superoxide dismutase and peroxidase-like functions, which play a major role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review discusses the properties of non-Ti MXenes, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial activity, and neuroprotective effects, highlighting their potential in various biomedical applications. These properties can be leveraged to mitigate oxidative stress and develop safe and innovative strategies for managing chronic diseases. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the various biomedical applications of non-Ti MXenes, including their use in drug delivery and combinatorial therapies and as nanozymes for sensing and therapeutic purposes. The theranostic applications of non-Ti MXenes are also discussed. Finally, the antibacterial properties of non-Ti MXenes and the proposed mechanisms are discussed. The review concludes with a summary of the key findings and future perspectives. In short, this review provides a thorough analysis of the biomedical applications of non-Ti MXenes, emphasizing their unique properties, potential opportunities and challenges in the field.",
