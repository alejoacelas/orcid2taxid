During my early research years I studied the innate immune system as a source of novel antibiotics, using the antimicrobial structural determinants of the human ribonucleases to develop new therapeutic agents.\n\nAfter my PhD I moved to Imperial College London as a Postdoctoral Scientist in Professor Hohenester's Laboratory, where I expanded my knowledge and skills in protein production, structural biology and biophysics, especially in X-ray crystallography.\n\nAfter my first postdoctoral experience I moved to the Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Oxford, where I consolidated myself as a structural biologist and protein production expert, developing novel drugs against autophagy regulators.\n\nCurrently, I am a Senior Postdoctoral Scientist working in Professor Simon J Draper's laboratory at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. My work is focused in the identification of improved antigen targets within the blood-stage merozoite malaria parasite; and the development and production of structure-guided protein based vaccines according to GMP standards.",

      "biography": "Patrick Musole Bugeme is a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSP). He earned his Medical Doctor degree in 2021 and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical sciences from the Université Catholique de Bukavu (UCB). He has completed the Epidemiology in Public Health Practice specialization program of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU). He has also undertaken specialized training in Intermediate Epidemiology, Clinical Research and Vaccinology. He is a health worker trained in global health and health challenges in Africa from the Université Paris Cité. \nDuring his medical studies at the UCB, he was in charge of student scientific research group and played a key role in the design and conduct of student research projets.\n\nOver the past three years, Dr Bugeme has been working at the Infectious Diseases Dynamics Group of the JHBSP as a research data coordinator and the study site manager of a research project aiming to assess the effectiveness and impact of mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns on cholera incidence and transmission dynamics in Uvira, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He has taken the lead in coordinating both cholera clinical surveillance, case-control vaccine effectiveness studies, and cross-sectional households surveys. He is coordinating a 2-year cohort study measuring cholera antibody kinetics in both post-infection and post vaccination period.  During a cholera mass vaccination campaign in late 2023, Dr. Bugeme coordinated the implementation of a paper-based register of over 250,000 people, which has been digitalized and is being validated for use in future vaccine studies in Uvira.\nSince the second semester of 2024, he is actively contributing to the Uvira Health Zone Monkeypox response efforts in the city, playing a significant role in case management and establishing clinical surveillance and contact tracing during the ongoing outbreak in Uvira.\n\nDr Bugeme is also affiliated with the Center for Tropical Disease and Global Health (CTDGH) of the UCB and has recently contributed to studies on vaccine confidence and uptake in the eastern DRC, working as a co-lead study investigator on the DRC-COVID-19 Vaccine-Confidence research project. Within the CTDGH, Patrick works also on surveillance of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance in Bukavu and surrounding health zones in the South Kivu province in DRC, using both human and mosquito samples. \n\nHe is also working as a volunteering physician in the pediatrics department at Uvira General Referral Hospital in Clinical and para-clinical diagnosis process. Patrick has over ten publications in peer reviewed journals both as the first author and co-author. His interests include vaccine preventable diseases, vaccine hesitancy/confidence, and global heath.",

I study viruses that are transmitted from animals to humans (Zoonotic Viruses) that have the potential to cause high consequence human disease outbreaks. My expertise is in Viral disease, Immunology and Vaccine development. A detailed understanding of the deleterious versus protective immune responses to RNA viruses enables us to design safer vaccines with broader protection for prevention and control from highly variable RNA viruses. Research at the LVZ spans human and veterinary medicine as we trace the origins and evolution of pathogens and their hosts. In 2017 we established new technology to make vastly improved vaccine antigens, and spun-out DIOSynVax Ltd out of Cambridge to deliver NextGen vaccine antigens for vaccines to prevent future pandemics.",

His work has been published in the Michigan Law Review, Texas Law Review, George Washington Law Review, and other leading law journals.  He has made numerous scholarly presentations and has taught and lectured at universities around the world.  Professor Magarian received his B.A. summa cum laude from Yale and his J.D. magna cum laude, as well as a master’s degree in public policy, from the University of Michigan, where he was editor-in-chief of the Michigan Law Review.  He served as a law clerk for Justice John Paul Stevens of the U.S. Supreme Court and Judge Louis Oberdorfer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
