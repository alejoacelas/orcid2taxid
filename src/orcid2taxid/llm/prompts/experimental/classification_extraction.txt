You will be analyzing a scientific paper to classify various aspects of the research. Follow these steps carefully:

1. You will be given the title and abstract of a scientific paper. This content will be enclosed in <scientific_paper> tags.

<scientific_paper>
{{ paper_content }}
</scientific_paper>

2. Based on the content, you need to classify the paper according to the following categories:

a) Whether the publication involves wet lab work (wet_lab_work):
- "yes" - Paper involves wet lab work
- "no" - Paper does not involve wet lab work
- "mixed" - Paper involves both wet and dry lab work
- "undetermined" - Cannot be determined from the content

b) Highest Biosafety Level mentioned in the work (bsl_level):
- "bsl_1" - Well-characterized agents not known to cause disease in healthy adults
- "bsl_2" - Agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and environment
- "bsl_3" - Indigenous or exotic agents with potential for aerosol transmission
- "bsl_4" - Dangerous/exotic agents with high risk of life-threatening disease
- "not_specified" - BSL level not mentioned in publication
- "not_applicable" - BSL classification not relevant to this work

c) How the synthetic DNA is being used (dna_use):
- "gene_expression" - Production of RNA/protein from synthetic DNA
- "cloning" - Construction of recombinant DNA molecules
- "genome_editing" - Modification of genomic DNA (CRISPR, etc.)
- "library_construction" - Creation of collections of DNA molecules
- "diagnostics" - Development/use of diagnostic tests or assays
- "vaccine_development" - Creation of vaccine candidates
- "therapeutics" - Development of therapeutic agents
- "primers_probes" - Use as primers or probes for PCR/hybridization
- "structure_studies" - Investigation of DNA/RNA structure
- "metabolic_engineering" - Alteration of cellular metabolism
- "synthetic_biology" - Engineering novel biological parts/systems
- "other_specified" - Other use clearly specified in publication
- "not_specified" - Use not clearly specified in publication

d) Researcher's experience with novel/hybrid sequences (novel_sequence_experience):
- "yes" - Multiple previous publications with novel/hybrid sequences
- "no" - One or few previous publications with novel/hybrid sequences
- "unclear" - Cannot be determined from available publications

e) Type of synthetic DNA used in the research (dna_type):
- "oligonucleotides" - Short DNA sequences, typically <100bp
- "gene_fragments" - Partial genes or genetic elements
- "complete_genes" - Full-length genes
- "regulatory_elements" - Promoters, enhancers, etc.
- "vectors" - Plasmids, viral vectors, etc.
- "whole_genome" - Complete genomes or chromosomes
- "multiple_types" - Combination of different DNA types
- "synthetic_genome" - Fully or partially synthetic genome
- "other_specified" - Other type clearly specified in publication
- "not_specified" - Type not clearly specified in publication

3. Prepare your output in the following format:

<output>
<classification>
{
    "wet_lab_work": "value",
    "bsl_level": "value",
    "dna_use": ["value1", "value2", ...],
    "novel_sequence_experience": "value",
    "dna_type": ["value1", "value2", ...]
}
</classification>

<justification>
[Provide your justification here, explaining the reasoning behind each classification]
</justification>
</output>

4. Guidelines for classification:
- Be conservative in your classifications. If you're unsure, use "undetermined" or "not_specified"
- For lists (dna_use and dna_type), include all applicable values
- Base your classifications on explicit mentions in the text rather than assumptions
- Consider the context and methods described in the paper
- If certain aspects are not mentioned, use the appropriate "not_specified" value
