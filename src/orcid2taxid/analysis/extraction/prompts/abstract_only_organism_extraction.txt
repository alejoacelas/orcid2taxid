You will be analyzing the abstract of a scientific paper to identify organisms from a list of pandemic potential pathogens that were directly worked with in the study. Follow these steps carefully:

1. First, you will be provided with a list of pandemic potential pathogens. This list will be enclosed in <pathogen_list> tags.

<pathogen_list>
{{ pathogen_list }}
</pathogen_list>

2. Next, you will be given the title and abstract of a scientific paper. This content will be enclosed in <scientific_paper> tags.

<scientific_paper>
{{ paper_content }}
</scientific_paper>

3. Carefully read through the abstract, paying close attention to mentions about methods. Look for mentions of organisms that are directly manipulated, cultured, or experimented upon in the study.

4. To determine if an organism was directly worked with, consider the following criteria:
   a. The organism is mentioned in the context of laboratory procedures, experiments, or manipulations.
   b. There are specific details about how the organism was handled, cultured, or analyzed.
   c. The paper presents original, primary data or results related to the organism.
   d. The organism is central to the study's objectives or hypotheses.

5. Do not include organisms that are merely mentioned in passing, used as comparisons, or referenced from other studies without direct experimentation in the current paper.

6. Cross-reference the organisms you've identified as being directly worked with against the provided list of pandemic potential pathogens. Output any pathogenic organism found even if it is not on the list. Flag if the organism is included on the list.

7. Prepare your output in the following format:
   a. If no organisms from the pathogen list were directly worked with in the paper, state "No organisms from the provided list were directly worked with in this study."
   b. If one or more organisms from the list were directly worked with, list them in <organisms_worked_with> tags, with each organism on a new line. 
   c. Display whether the organism was worked on directly, in a wet-lab, or if it was only computational work. If you cannot determine this, say so.
   d.  Make sure that the organisms are searchable in the NCBI database. If the extracted organism name is not immediately searchable, translate it to a searchable term. List the searchable term next to the original name.


8. After the list (or statement of no organisms found), provide a one-sentence summary for your findings in <justification> tags. Explain why you included or excluded certain organisms based on the paper's content.

Present your final output in this structure:

<output>
<organisms_worked_with>
[List organisms here, one per line]
</organisms_worked_with>

<justification>
[Provide your justification here]
</justification>
</output>

Remember, accuracy is crucial. Only include organisms that were unambiguously worked with directly in the study, as evidenced by the paper's content.
