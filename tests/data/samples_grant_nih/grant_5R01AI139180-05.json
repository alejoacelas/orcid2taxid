      "abstract_text": "Innate immunity senses intracellular pathogens and induces the expression of cellular genes with\nantiviral functions. Most if not all viruses encode proteins that inhibit innate immunity during productive, lytic\ninfections, but the role of innate immunity during viral latency is underappreciated and understudied.\nLatency permits human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to colonize its hosts for their lifetime by avoiding immune\ndetection and clearance. During latency, the levels of lytic (productive) phase HCMV proteins such as IE1\n(Immediate Early 1) are kept extremely low (or completely absent) because the promoter that drives its\nexpression, the Major Immediate Early Promoter (MIEP) is transcriptionally silenced by heterochromatin.\nIE1 is a transcription factor that promotes progression through the viral lytic phase and is a target of\ncytotoxic T cells. Therefore, keeping IE1 protein levels low or absent protects latently infected cells from\nimmune surveillance and restricts reactivation events until the proper stimulus is sensed. We published that\nthe viral UL138 protein silences IE1 transcription during latency by inhibiting the recruitment of lysine-\nspecific demethylases (KDMs) to the MIEP that otherwise remove repressive epigenetic histone\nmethylations to activate transcription. Our preliminary data indicates this occurs, in part, through a\nsuppression of cellular innate immune pathways. Here we propose to determine how UL138-mediated\nevasion of cellular innate immunity contributes to the establishment and maintenance of HCMV latency, with\na particular focus on viral epigenetics and the transcriptional silencing of IE1.",

      "phr_text": "Narrative\nHuman cytomegalovirus infects almost everyone. It causes birth defects and disease in\npeople sick with cancer, AIDS, and those undergoing organ transplants. It also seems\nto exacerbate cardiovascular diseases, to adversely affect the ability of the elderly to\nfight off other infectious diseases, and may be directly related to human glioblastoma\nmultiforme brain tumors. HCMV can hide in the body in a latent state and reactivate at\nany time to cause disease and to spread from person to person. This work will study\nhow HCMV establishes this latent state, with the hopes of identifying ways to fight the\nvirus with antiviral drugs.",
