      "abstract": "This review explores the application of the Simplex representation of molecular structure (SiRMS) QSAR approach in antiviral research. We provide an introduction to and description of SiRMS, its application in antiviral research and future directions of development of the Simplex approach and the whole QSAR field. In the Simplex approach every molecule is represented as a system of different simplexes (tetratomic fragments with fixed composition, structure, chirality and symmetry). The main advantages of SiRMS are consideration of the different physical-chemical properties of atoms, high adequacy and good interpretability of models obtained and clear procedures for molecular design. The reliability of developed QSAR models as predictive virtual screening tools and their ability to serve as the basis of directed drug design was validated by subsequent synthetic and biological experiments. The SiRMS approach is realized as the complex of the computer program 'HiT QSAR', which is available on request.",

      "abstract": "Foot and Mouth Disease Virus causes continuously annoying outbreaks and massive animal illnesses. Usually, the potential influence of the disease was due to the emergence of conquered emergent new strains or re-emergence of local strains with major antigenic variations due to the mutation in the genetic strip. Therefore, the proposed work is based on the genetic characterization of the virus by VP1 codon sequencing in the tested samples. Besides, the viral physiological testing using BHK-21 cell lines and the ELISA test for FMDV antigen serotyping. Positive serotype A samples were furtherly analyzed for nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequences showed that they belonged to the FMD serotype A African topotypes originating from the ancestor prototype SUD/77 with a similarity of 98.48 ± 1.2% with each other. The divergence was 9.3% from the other local isolates from 2020. Additionally, they are closely related to the Egyptian-Damietta type-2016 and the Sudanese-2018 by 96.84 ± 1.01% and 95.84 ± 0.79%, respectively. Moreover, the divergence with the vaccinal strains ranged from 10 to 17%. Ultimately, the analysis of the amino acid showed that the isolates have variation in the most prominent antigenic regionsof of, allocated at residues 35–75, and at the immunogenic determinants of the G-H loop of VP1 (residues 100–146, residues 161–175). Therefore, the current isolates should be included in the vaccine to provide broader immunogenic coverages against serotype A-African topotypes.",

      "title": "Circulating foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype A African-genotype IV in Egypt during 2022.",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aim</h4>Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus causes continuous outbreaks, leading to serious economic consequences that affect animal productivity and restrict trade movement. The potential influence of the disease was due to the emergence of new strains or re-emergence of local strains with major antigenic variations due to genetic mutations. This study aims to evaluate circulating virus in samples collected from infected animals during an outbreak using antigenic characterization and identify whether there is an emergence of a new strain or mutation.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to screen 86 samples. Viral protein 1 (VP1) codon sequencing was performed. The virus was isolated from the samples inoculated on the baby-hamster kidney cell line and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed for serotyping and antigen detection.<h4>Results</h4>Based on the RT-PCR screening results, 10 positive samples were selected for sequencing. The sequences belonged to the FMD serotype A African topotype originating from the ancestor prototype Sudan/77, with which it shared 98.48% ± 1.2% similarity. The divergence with local isolates from 2020 was 9.3%. In addition, the sequences were 96.84% ± 1.01% and 95.84% ± 0.79% related to Egyptian-Damietta type 2016 and Sudanese-2018, respectively. Divergence with vaccinal strains ranged from 10% to 17%. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the isolates had variation in the most prominent antigenic regions (residues 35-75) and the immunogenic determinants of the G-H loop of VP1 (residues 100-146 and 161-175).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current isolates should be included in the locally produced vaccine to provide broader immunogenic coverage against serotype A African topotypes.",

We conducted this study to determine the prevalence of persistent infections (PI) and identify the current strain among some dairy cattle herds in Egypt. A total of 240 serum samples were collected from six Egyptian provinces. Between 2019 and 2020, samples were tested by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of PI animals, and then molecular characterization was performed. Six calves were found PI with a prevalence of 2.5% (6/240). Using molecular characterization, HoBi-like Pestivirus (BVD-3) was successfully identified in Egypt for the first time. Based on the BVD-3 reference strains on Genbank, the detected strains had an identity ranging from 98.8 to 99.6%. Partial nucleotide sequence of the 5'UTR gene for six tested samples was submitted to Genbank with accessions: OM324396, OM324397, OM324398, OM324399, OM3243100, and OM3243101.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background and aim</h4>Bovine papillomaviruses (BPV) are a heterogeneous group of oncoviruses, distributed globally, which produce major economic losses. In the current study, we compared the results of different diagnostic approaches and compared the strains identified in this study with previously characterized strains at local and international levels.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Samples of skin warts were collected from five bovines with generalized papillomatosis from two Egyptian provinces, Menya and Ismailia, in 2020. Electron microscopy, molecular characterization, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examination were performed.<h4>Results</h4>BPV was detected using electron microscopy in the collected samples. Using molecular characterization, BPV-2 was successfully identified for 1<sup>st</sup> time in Egypt. The strain has 99.6% identity with the BPV-2 reference strains obtained from GenBank. These results were supported by histopathology and immunohistochemistry examination. Partial nucleotide sequences of the L1 gene were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MW289843 and MW289844.<h4>Conclusion</h4>BPV-2 was reported for 1<sup>st</sup> time in the current study. The strain was identified grossly, microscopically, and pathologically and confirmed using molecular approaches. All results were consistent. The sequence analysis revealed that this strain has high sequence similarity to the reference Deltapapillomavirus-4, BPV-2 strains from Brazil and China.",

      "abstract": "The first nationally representative, population-based study of schistosomiasis seroprevalence in Nigeria was conducted using blood samples and risk-factor data collected during the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS). Schistosomiasis seroprevalence was estimated by analyzing samples for reactivity to schistosome soluble egg antigen (SEA) in a multiplex bead assay; NAIIS survey data were assessed to identify potential risk factors for seropositivity. The SEA antibody data were available for 31,459 children aged 0 to 14 years. Overall seroprevalence was 17.2% (95% CI: 16.3-18.1%). Seropositive children were identified in every age group, including children < 5 years, and seroprevalence increased with increasing age (P < 0.0001). Several factors were associated with increased odds of seropositivity, including being a boy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.45), living in a rural area (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.9-2.5), and animal ownership (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.52-1.85). Access to improved sanitation and drinking water sources were associated with decreased odds of seropositivity (OR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.47-0.58 and OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.47-0.60, respectively) regardless of whether the child lived in a rural (sanitation: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8; drinking water: aOR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6-0.8) or urban area (sanitation: aOR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5-0.7; drinking water: aOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.6), highlighting the importance of these factors for schistosomiasis prevention and control. These results identified additional risk populations (children < 5 years) and a new risk factor (animal ownership) and could be used to monitor the impact of control programs.",

      "abstract": "Serosurveillance can provide estimates of population-level exposure to infectious pathogens and has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneous, serological testing for multiple pathogens can be done using bead-based immunoassays to add value to disease-specific serosurveys. We conducted a validation of four SARS-CoV-2 antigens-full-length spike protein, two receptor binding domain proteins, and the nucleocapsid protein-on our existing multiplex bead assay (MBA) for enteric diseases, malaria, and vaccine preventable diseases. After determining the optimal conditions for coupling the antigens to microsphere beads, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were determined on two instruments (Luminex-200 and MAGPIX) when testing singly (monoplex) versus combined (multiplex). Sensitivity was assessed using plasma from 87 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) positive persons collected in March-May of 2020 and ranged from 94.3% to 96.6% for the different testing conditions. Specificity was assessed using 98 plasma specimens collected prior to December 2019 and plasma from 19 rRT-PCR negative persons and ranged from 97.4% to 100%. The positive percent agreement was 93.8% to 97.9% using 48 specimens collected > 21 days post-symptom onset, while the negative percent agreement was ≥ 99% for all antigens. Test performance was similar using monoplex or multiplex testing. Integrating SARS-CoV-2 serology with other diseases of public health interest could add significant value to public health programs that have suffered severe programmatic setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Multiplex assays for malaria antigen detection can gather data from large sample sets, but considerations for the consistency and quality assurance (QA) of mass testing lack evaluation. We present a QA framework for a study occurring November 2019 to March 2020 involving 504 assay plates detecting four Plasmodium antigens: pan-Plasmodium aldolase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), P. vivax LDH (PvLDH). Controls on each plate included buffer blank, antigen negative blood, and 4-point positive dilution curve. The blank and negative blood provided consistently low signal for all targets except for pAldolase, which showed variability. Positive curve signals decreased throughout the 5-month study duration but retained a coefficient of variation (CV) of < 5%, with the exception of HRP2 in month 5 (CV of 11%). Regression fittings for inter-plate control signals provided mean and standard deviations (SDs), and of 504 assay plates, 6 (1.2%) violated the acceptable deviation limits and were repeated. For the 40,272 human blood samples assayed in this study, of 161,088 potential data points (each sample × 4 antigens), 160,641 (99.7%) successfully passed quality checks. The QA framework presented here can be utilized to ensure quality of laboratory antigen detection for large sample sets.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>There is a need for reliable serological assays to determine accurate estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence. Most single target antigen assays have shown some limitations in Africa. To assess the performance of a multi-antigen assay, we evaluated a commercially available SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay for human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Nigeria.<h4>Methods</h4>Validation of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was carried out using well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reactive positive (97) and pre-COVID-19 pandemic (86) plasma panels. Cross-reactivity was assessed using pre-COVID-19 pandemic plasma specimens (213) from the 2018 Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS).<h4>Results</h4>The overall sensitivity of the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay was 75.3% [95% CI: 65.8%- 82.8%] and specificity was 99.0% [95% CI: 96.8%- 99.7%]. The sensitivity estimate increased to 83.3% [95% CI: 70.4%- 91.3%] for specimens >14 days post-confirmation of diagnosis. However, using the NAIIS pre-pandemic specimens, the false positivity rate was 1.4% (3/213).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results showed overall lower sensitivity and a comparable specificity with the manufacturer's validation. There appears to be less cross-reactivity with NAIIS pre-pandemic COVID-19 specimens using the xMAP SARS-CoV-2 Multi-Antigen IgG assay. In-country SARS-CoV-2 serology assay validation can help guide the best choice of assays in Africa.",

      "title": "Case of Fatal Hepatitis Related to HEV-3 Infection in Central Italy.",
      "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a global health problem, causing an estimated 20 million infections annually. Thus, the management of HEV requires special consideration. In developed countries, hepatitis E is mainly recognized as a foodborne disease (mainly transmitted via undercooked meat consumption) that is generally caused by genotype 3 and 4 circulating in various animals, including pigs and wild boars. The current absence of officially recognized protocols for the analysis of HEV in foods and the lack of awareness of this disease among healthcare workers, together with the high percentage of asymptomatic cases, make HEV infection highly underestimated. Most HEV-3 infections in immunocompetent individuals are self-limited. Nevertheless, the possibility of serious forms of liver disease, especially in patients with co-morbidities, should be considered because it can lead to a fatal outcome. Here, we report a case of fatal hepatitis related to HEV-3 infection in a 67-year-old male patient with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) and living in a region where a high prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of HEV-3 in wild boar has been recently demonstrated. Our case report describes the interdisciplinary approach used (from the diagnosis to the virus phylogenetic characterization) in order to improve epidemiologic HEV surveillance in central Italy.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial activity of many AMPs can be improved by lysine-to-arginine substitution due to a more favourable interaction of arginine guanidinium moiety with bacterial membranes. In a previous work, the structural and functional characterization of an amphipathic antimicrobial peptide named RiLK1, including lysine and arginine as the positively charged amino acids in its sequence, was reported. Specifically, RiLK1 retained its β-sheet structure under a wide range of environmental conditions (temperature, pH, and ionic strength), and exhibited bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungal pathogens with no evidence of toxicity on mammalian cells. To further elucidate the influence of a lysine-to-arginine replacement on RiLK1 conformational properties, antimicrobial activity and peptide-liposome interaction, a new RiLK1-derivative, named RiLK3, in which the lysine is replaced with an arginine residue, was projected and characterised in comparison with its parental compound. The results evidenced that lysine-to-arginine mutation not only did not assure an improvement in the antimicrobial potency of RiLK1 in terms of bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal activities, but rather it was completely abolished against the hepatitis A virus. Therefore, RiLK1 exhibited a wide range of antimicrobial activity like other cationic peptides, although the exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood. Moreover, tryptophan fluorescence measurements confirmed that RiLK3 bound to negatively charged lipid vesicles with an affinity lower than that of RiLK1, although no substantial differences from the structural and self-assembled point of view were evidenced. Therefore, our findings imply that antimicrobial efficacy and selectivity are affected by several complex and interrelated factors related to substitution of lysine with arginine, such as their relative proportion and position. In this context, this study could provide a better rationalisation for the optimization of antimicrobial peptide sequences, paving the way for the development of novel AMPs with broad applications.",

      "abstract": "Food-borne transmission is a recognized route for many viruses associated with gastrointestinal, hepatic, or neurological diseases. Therefore, it is essential to identify new bioactive compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity to exploit innovative solutions against these hazards. Recently, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been recognized as promising antiviral agents. Indeed, while the antibacterial and antifungal effects of these molecules have been widely reported, their use as potential antiviral agents has not yet been fully investigated. Herein, the antiviral activity of previously identified or newly designed AMPs was evaluated against the non-enveloped RNA viruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and murine norovirus (MNV), a surrogate for human norovirus. Moreover, specific assays were performed to recognize at which stage of the viral infection cycle the peptides could function. The results showed that almost all peptides displayed virucidal effects, with about 90% of infectivity reduction in HAV or MNV. However, the decapeptide RiLK1 demonstrated, together with its antibacterial and antifungal properties, a notable reduction in viral infection for both HAV and MNV, possibly through direct interaction with viral particles causing their damage or hindering the recognition of cellular receptors. Hence, RiLK1 could represent a versatile antimicrobial agent effective against various foodborne pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and fungi.",

      "abstract": "In recent studies, emphasis has been placed on the zonula occludens toxin (Zot) from the non-toxigenic <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> strain PMC53.7 as an agent inducing alterations in the actin cytoskeleton of infected Caco-2 cells and which appears as a relevant virulence factor. Universal <i>zot</i> primers were designed by the alignment of different types of <i>zot</i> gene and identification of conserved sequences to investigate the presence in diverse environmental and clinical <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> isolates, in co-occurrence with virulence factors, such a hemolysins and secretion systems. The study screened a total of 390 isolates from environmental sources from Chile and Italy and 95 Chilean clinical isolates. The results revealed that around 37.2% of Chilean environmental strains and 25.9% of Italian strains, and 24.2% of clinical isolates carried the <i>zot</i> gene. The Zot-C2 cluster was present in 71.4% of Chilean environmental strains but absent in clinical isolates, while the Zot-C4 cluster was identified in 28.6% of environmental and 100% of clinical isolates. Understanding the role of <i>zot</i> in <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> virulence is crucial, especially considering the risk associated with consuming diverse isolates from bivalves and the co-occurrence with virulence factors such as TDH, TRH or T3SS2.",

      "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs), a subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae, are viruses that sometimes present a zoonotic character. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, which, since its outbreak in 2019, has caused about 774,593,066 confirmed cases and 7,028,881 deaths. Aereosols are the main route of transmission among people; however, viral droplets can contaminate surfaces and fomites as well as particulate matter (PM) in suspensions of natural and human origin. Honey bees are well known bioindicators of the presence of pollutants and PMs in the environment as they can collect a great variety of substances during their foraging activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of honey bees as bioindicators of the prevalence SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, 91 samples of honey bees and 6 of honey were collected from different apiaries of Campania region (Southern Italy) in four time periods from September 2020 to June 2022 and were analyzed with Droplet Digital RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 target genes Orf1b and N. The screening revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 12/91 in honey bee samples and in 2/6 honey samples. These results suggest that honey bees could also be used as indicators of outbreaks of airborne pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2.",

      "title": "The human cytomegalovirus nuclear egress complex unites multiple functions: Recruitment of effectors, nuclear envelope rearrangement, and docking to nuclear capsids.",
      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Nuclear replication represents a common hallmark of herpesviruses achieved by a number of sequentially unrolled regulatory processes. A rate-limiting step is provided by nucleo-cytoplasmic capsid export, for which a defined multiregulatory protein complex, namely, the nuclear egress complex (NEC), is assembled comprising both viral and cellular components. The NEC regulates at least 3 aspects of herpesviral nuclear replication: (1) multimeric recruitment of NEC-associated effector proteins, (2) reorganization of the nuclear lamina and membranes, and (3) the docking to nuclear capsids. Here, we review published data and own experimental work that characterizes the NEC of HCMV and other herpesviruses.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of information on nuclear egress of HCMV compared to selected alpha-, beta-, and gamma-herpesviruses: proteomics-based approaches, high-resolution imaging techniques, and functional investigations.<h4>Results</h4>A large number of reports on herpesviral NECs have been published during the last two decades, focusing on protein-protein interactions, nuclear localization, regulatory phosphorylation, and functional validation. The emerging picture provides an illustrated example of well-balanced and sophisticated protein networking in virus-host interaction.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Current evidence refined the view about herpesviral NECs. Datasets published for HCMV, murine CMV, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus illustrate the marked functional consistency in the way herpesviruses achieve nuclear egress. However, this compares with only limited sequence conservation of core NEC proteins and a structural conservation restricted to individual domains. The translational use of this information might help to define a novel antiviral strategy on the basis of NEC-directed small molecules.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Allergic diseases have escalated to epidemic levels worldwide, impacting nearly 30% of the global population. Fungi are a significant source of allergens responsible for up to 6% of respiratory diseases in the general population. However, the specific cause of respiratory allergies often remains unidentified. This study aimed to investigate the potential of two common rust fungi, <i>Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae</i> and <i>Phragmidium rubi-idaei</i>, to trigger a proinflammatory response in vitro models representing the upper and lower respiratory tract.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The BEAS-2B and A549 cell lines simulated upper and lower respiratory endothelial cells. The cytotoxicity of fungal extracts was evaluated using MTT and flow cytometry assays. Cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured via flow cytometry, while ELISA tests quantified the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Immunofluorescence techniques were employed to assess cell integrity markers.<h4>Results</h4>Extracts from <i>T. pruni-spinosae</i> and <i>P. rubi-idaei</i> significantly stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and GM-CSF in both cell lines, all of which are associated with the development of allergic responses. The increase in these cytokines and the elevated ROS production were linked to the disruption of epithelial cell junctions.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings suggest the potential of <i>T. pruni-spinosae</i> and <i>P. rubi-idaei</i> extracts to collectively disrupt the epithelial barrier in the upper and lower respiratory tract by inducing proinflammatory cytokines and the production of reactive oxygen species and metalloproteinases. Although none of the above parameters was spectacularly high, all of them together could cause a decrease in the presence of tight junction proteins, such as E-cadherin and occludin, in epithelial cells.",

      "abstract": "By June 2022, COVID-19 vaccine coverage in low-income countries remained low, while the emergence of the highly-transmissible but less clinically-severe Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the assumption expressed outside the academic realm that Omicron may offer a natural solution to the pandemic. The present paper argues that this assumption is based on the false premise that this variant could be the final evolutionary step of SARS-CoV-2. There remains a risk of the emergence of novel viral subvariants and recombinants, and entirely novel lineages, the clinical consequences of which are hard to predict. This is particularly important for regions with a high share of immunocompromised individuals, such as those living with HIV/AIDS, in whom SARS-CoV-2 can persist for months and undergo selection pressure. The vaccination of the least-vaccinated regions should remain the integral strategy to control viral evolution and its potential global consequences in developed countries, some of which have decided to ease sanitary and testing measures in response to the rise and dominance of the Omicron variant. We argue that low-income countries require help in improving COVID-19 vaccine availability, decreasing vaccine hesitancy, and increasing the understanding of long-term vaccination goals during the circulation of a viral variant that causes milder disease.",

      "abstract": "<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is the primary causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. The mutant-type strain interrupted in the ORF7 gene region responsible for the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis of the <i>L. pneumophila</i> strain Heysham-1, lacking the <i>O</i>-acetyl groups attached to the rhamnose of the core part, showed a higher surface polarity compared with the wild-type strain. The measurement of excitation energy transfer between fluorophores located on the surface of bacteria and eukaryotic cells showed that, at an early stage of interaction with host cells, the mutant exhibited weaker interactions with <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> cells and THP-1-derived macrophages. The mutant displayed reduced adherence to macrophages but enhanced adherence to <i>A. castellanii</i>, suggesting that the <i>O</i>-acetyl group of the LPS core region plays a crucial role in facilitating interaction with macrophages. The lack of core rhamnose <i>O</i>-acetyl groups made it easier for the bacteria to multiply in amoebae and macrophages. The mutant induced TNF-α production more strongly compared with the wild-type strain. The mutant synthesized twice as many ceramides Cer(t34:0) and Cer(t38:0) than the wild-type strain. The study showed that the internal sugars of the LPS core region of <i>L. pneumophila</i> sg 1 can interact with eukaryotic cell surface receptors and mediate in contacting and attaching bacteria to host cells as well as modulating the immune response to infection.",

      "abstract": "During persistent human papillomavirus infection, the viral genome replicates as an extrachromosomal plasmid that is efficiently partitioned to daughter cells during cell division. We have previously shown that an element which overlaps the human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) transcriptional enhancer promotes stable DNA replication of replicons containing the viral replication origin. Here, we perform comprehensive analyses to elucidate the function of this maintenance element. We conclude that no unique element or binding site in this region is absolutely required for persistent replication and partitioning and instead propose that the overall chromatin architecture of this region is important to promote efficient use of the replication origin. These results have important implications for the genome partitioning mechanism of papillomaviruses. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is responsible for ∼5% of human cancers. The viral DNA replicates as an extrachromosomal plasmid and is partitioned to daughter cells in dividing keratinocytes. Using a complementation assay that allows us to separate viral transcription and replication, we provide insight into viral sequences that are required for long-term replication and persistence in keratinocytes. Understanding how viral genomes replicate persistently for such long periods of time will guide the development of antiviral therapies.",

The HPV infectious cycle can sustain long-term infection in stratified epithelia because viral DNA is maintained as low copy number extrachromosomal plasmids in the dividing basal cells of a lesion, while progeny viral genomes are amplified to large numbers in differentiated superficial cells. The viral E1 and E2 proteins initiate viral DNA replication and maintain and partition viral genomes, in concert with the cellular replication machinery. Additionally, the E5, E6, and E7 proteins are required to evade host immune responses and to produce a cellular environment that supports viral DNA replication. An unfortunate consequence of the manipulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation is that cells become at high risk for carcinogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Persistent viral infections require a host cell reservoir that maintains functional copies of the viral genome. To this end, several DNA viruses maintain their genomes as extrachromosomal DNA minichromosomes in actively dividing cells. These viruses typically encode a viral protein that binds specifically to viral DNA genomes and tethers them to host mitotic chromosomes, thus enabling the viral genomes to hitchhike or piggyback into daughter cells. Viruses that use this tethering mechanism include papillomaviruses and the gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. This review describes the advantages and consequences of persistent extrachromosomal viral genome replication.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) employs small RNAs to target enzymes that methylate cytosine residues. Cytosine methylation and dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) are often linked. Together they condition an epigenetic defense that results in chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing of transposons and viral chromatin. Canonical RdDM (Pol IV-RdDM), involving RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V), was believed to be necessary to establish cytosine methylation, which in turn could recruit H3K9 methyltransferases. However, recent studies have revealed that a pathway involving Pol II and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) (RDR6-RdDM) is likely responsible for establishing cytosine methylation at naive loci, while Pol IV-RdDM acts to reinforce and maintain it. We used the geminivirus Beet curly top virus (BCTV) as a model to examine the roles of Pol IV and Pol V in establishing repressive viral chromatin methylation. As geminivirus chromatin is formed de novo in infected cells, these viruses are unique models for processes involved in the establishment of epigenetic marks. We confirm that Pol IV and Pol V are not needed to establish viral DNA methylation but are essential for its amplification. Remarkably, however, both Pol IV and Pol V are required for deposition of H3K9me2 on viral chromatin. Our findings suggest that cytosine methylation alone is not sufficient to trigger de novo deposition of H3K9me2 and further that Pol IV-RdDM is responsible for recruiting H3K9 methyltransferases to viral chromatin.<h4>Importance</h4>In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) uses small RNAs to target cytosine methylation, which is often linked to H3K9me2. These epigenetic marks silence transposable elements and DNA virus genomes, but how they are established is not well understood. Canonical RdDM, involving Pol IV and Pol V, was thought to establish cytosine methylation that in turn could recruit H3K9 methyltransferases, but recent studies compel a reevaluation of this view. We used BCTV to investigate the roles of Pol IV and Pol V in chromatin methylation. We found that both are needed to amplify, but not to establish, DNA methylation. However, both are required for deposition of H3K9me2. Our findings suggest that cytosine methylation is not sufficient to recruit H3K9 methyltransferases to naive viral chromatin and further that Pol IV-RdDM is responsible.",

      "abstract": "Plants employ RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and dimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2) to silence geminiviruses and transposable elements (TEs). We previously showed that canonical RdDM (Pol IV-RdDM) involving RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V) is required for <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> to recover from infection with <i>Beet curly top virus</i> lacking a suppressor protein that inhibits methylation (BCTV <i>L2</i><sup>-</sup>). Recovery, which is characterized by reduced viral DNA levels and symptom remission, allows normal floral development. Here, we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to confirm that >90% of BCTV <i>L2</i><sup>-</sup> chromatin is highly compacted during recovery, and a micrococcal nuclease-chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that this is largely due to increased nucleosome occupancy. Physical compaction correlated with augmented cytosine and H3K9 methylation and with reduced viral gene expression. We additionally demonstrated that these phenomena are dependent on Pol V and by extension the Pol IV-RdDM pathway. BCTV <i>L2</i><sup>-</sup> was also used to evaluate the impact of viral infection on host loci, including repressed retrotransposons <i>Ta3</i> and <i>Athila6A</i> Remarkably, an unexpected Pol V-dependent hypersuppression of these TEs was observed, resulting in transcript levels even lower than those detected in uninfected plants. Hypersuppression is likely to be especially important for natural recovery from wild-type geminiviruses, as viral L2 and AL2 proteins cause ectopic TE expression. Thus, Pol IV-RdDM targets both viral and TE chromatin during recovery, simultaneously silencing the majority of viral genomes and maintaining host genome integrity by enforcing tighter control of TEs in future reproductive tissues.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> In plants, RdDM pathways use small RNAs to target cytosine and H3K9 methylation, thereby silencing DNA virus genomes and transposable elements (TEs). Further, Pol IV-RdDM involving Pol IV and Pol V is a key aspect of host defense that can lead to recovery from geminivirus infection. Recovery is characterized by reduced viral DNA levels and symptom remission and thus allows normal floral development. Studies described here demonstrate that the Pol V-dependent enhanced viral DNA and histone methylation observed during recovery result in increased chromatin compaction and suppressed gene expression. In addition, we show that TE-associated chromatin is also targeted for hypersuppression during recovery, such that TE transcripts are reduced below the already low levels seen in uninfected plants. Thus, Pol IV-RdDM at once silences the majority of viral genomes and enforces a tight control over TEs which might otherwise jeopardize genome integrity in future reproductive tissue.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal and prevalent malignancies. While the overexpression of pioneer factor GATA6 in CRC has been linked with metastasis, its role in genome-wide gene expression dysregulation remains unclear. Through studies of primary human CRC tissues and analysis of the TCGA data, we found that GATA6 preferentially binds at CRC-specific active enhancers, with enrichment at enhancer-promoter loop anchors. GATA6 protein also physically interacts with CTCF, suggesting its critical role in 3D genome organization. The ablation of GATA6 through AID and CRISPR systems severely impaired cancer cell clonogenicity and proliferation. Mechanistically, GATA6 knockout induced global loss of CRC-specific open chromatins and extensive alterations of critical enhancer-promoter interactions for CRC oncogenes. Last, we showed that GATA6 knockout greatly reduced tumor growth and improved survival in mice. Together, we revealed a previously unidentified mechanism by which GATA6 contributes to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.",

      "abstract": "Among all of the known biological carcinogens, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are two of the classical oncogenic herpesviruses known to induce the oncogenic phenotype. Many studies have revealed important functions related to epigenetic alterations of the EBV and KSHV genomes that mediate oncogenesis, but the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. It is also challenging to fully describe the critical cellular events that drive oncogenesis as well as a comprehensive map of the molecular contributors. This review introduces the roles of epigenetic modifications of these viral genomes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNA expression, and elucidates potential strategies utilized for inducing oncogenesis by these human gammaherpesviruses.",

      "abstract": "Minority groups face barriers in accessing quality health care, professional advancement, and representation in immunology research efforts as a result of institutional racism that if unaddressed can perpetuate a lack of diversity. In 2021, the AAI Minority Affairs Committee convened a cross section of academic and industry scientists from underrepresented groups at various stages of their professions to discuss how best to address the toll racism takes on study design and scientific careers. Panelists drew directly from their own experiences as scientists to share perspectives and strategies for countering a lack of representation in clinical research, responding to microaggressions, navigating academic advancement, and providing effective mentorship. The session reinforced the need for minority scientists to take an active role in advocating for diversity, engaging mentors, and taking responsibility to face rather than avoid institutional obstacles. Overall, increased dialogue and institutional awareness of the experience of scientists from underrepresented groups in research remain the best tools to ensure a health equity mindset and advancement of their careers.",

      "abstract": "Viruses are exemplary molecular biologists and have been integral to scientific discovery for generations. It is therefore no surprise that nuclear replicating viruses have evolved to systematically take over host cell function through astoundingly specific nuclear and chromatin hijacking. In this review, we focus on nuclear replicating DNA viruses-herpesviruses and adenoviruses-as key examples of viral invasion in the nucleus. We concentrate on critical features of nuclear architecture, such as chromatin and the nucleolus, to illustrate the complexity of the virus-host battle for resources in the nucleus. We conclude with a discussion of the technological advances that have enabled the discoveries we describe and upcoming steps in this burgeoning field.",

Severe forms of influenza are usually characterized by vascular endothelial cells damage. Thus, influenza A viruses, including subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), as well as highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, can infect the vascular endothelium, leading to activation and subsequent dysfunction of these cells. In turn, endothelial dysfunction resulting in systemic morphofunctional changes of endothelial cells, which leads to impaired vascular tone, thrombosis and other complications, and is also a risk factor and profoundly implicated in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases. Thus, endothelial dysfunction is an important aspect of the pathogenesis of severe influenza, which must be considered in the pathogenetic therapy of this infectious disease. The aim of the review is to analyze the causes and specify mechanisms of development of endothelial activation and dysfunction caused by influenza A virus.",

Influenza viruses A/H1N1 (A/Brevig Mission/1/18), A/St. Petersburg /RII04/2016 (H1N1)pdm09, coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (strain Wuhan-Hu-1) were used for comparative computer analysis. The sources of the primary structures of proteins of the analyzed viruses and 41 proteins of the human hemostatic system were publicly available Internet databases, respectively, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and www.nextprot.org. The search for homologous sequences in the structure of viral proteins and hemostatic proteins was carried out by comparing fragments of 12 amino acids in length, taking as related those that showed identity at ≥8 positions. <b>Results</b>. Comparative analysis of the repertoire of cellular proteins of the hemostatic system and fragments mimicking these proteins in the structure of proteins of viruses A/H1N1 1918, A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated in 2016, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, showed a significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 and analyzed viruses. In the protein structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, mimicry was revealed for almost all analyzed hemostasis proteins. As for the comparison of viruses A/H1N1 1918, A(H1N1)pdm09 2016 and SARS-CoV, the influenza virus A/H1N1 1918 and SARS-CoV are the closest in the repertoire of hemostatic proteins. <b>Conclusion</b>. Obtained bioinformatic analysis data can serve as a basis for further study of the role of homologous fragments in the regulation of hemostasis of the host organism.",

This result has been tested and proven on culture EAhy 926 treated with nocodazole. Compared with lung carcinoma cells A549, in which influenza virus provokes the arrest of G0/G1 phase of the cycle, elongation of S-phase of cycle at a similar infection of endothelial culture EAhy 926 indicates that the influenza virus differently affects the dynamics of the cell cycle according to the origin of the infected culture.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Introduction</h4>Influenza A virus infection can lead to endothelial dysfunction (ED), including apoptosis of endothelial cells and modulation of endothelial factor activities. Affected biochemical factors may include those playing important roles in vascular homeostasis. However, the effect of this pathogen on the expression pattern of key endothelial factors is still unknown.The aim of this work was to study the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, serpin E1) in the EA.hy926 endothelial cells.<h4>Research objectives</h4>to assess expression of eNOS and PAI-1 in endothelial cells infected with influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09, and to identify homologous fragments in structure of viral proteins and endothelial factors.<h4>Material and methods</h4>Cells were infected with influenza virus A/St. Petersburg/48/16 (H1N1)pdm09 and analyzed in dynamics in 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 hrs post infection (hpi). Detection of endothelial factors expression levels was performed by immunocytochemical method (ICC) using antibodies for eNOS and PAI-1 while quantitative assessment of expression levels was carried out by program Nis-Elements F3.2 («Nikon», Japan). The search for homologous sequences between viral proteins and eNOS and PAI-1 was performed by computer comparison. Sequences were analyzed as fragments 12 amino acid residues (aar) in length.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>eNOS expression in infected cells had decreased to 7.9% by 6 hpi (control was taken as 100%) to 3.3% at 72 hpi. PAI-1 expression varied significantly over the course of the experiment: by 6 hpi it had decreased to 49.6%, and to 43.2% by 12 hpi. Later PAI-1 levels were: 116.3% (18 hpi); 18.9% (24 hpi); 23.5% (48 hpi), and 35% (72 hpi).<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results indicate that influenza A infection of endothelial cells causes a significant decrease in eNOS expression, while modulating PAI-1 one. The described phenomenon can be used in the further development of directions of pathogenetic therapy of vascular complications of infection caused by this pathogen.",

It was questioned how the viruses and their surface proteins that were studied cause the activation of caspase-3 after 0.5 h of exposure that recorded immunogistotsitohimicheski. The test viruses and neuraminidase (concentration 10 μg/ml) led to the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the cell membrane in a time interval of 2-8 h from the beginning of the treatment, which was recorded by flow cytometry. The death of endothelial cells when exposed to the HA (in a concentration of 50 μg/ml) and in the same time frame was not accompanied by the appearance of phosphatidylserine. The specific feature of apoptotic cell death during the reproduction of the virus are described, as well as the effects of viral proteins.",

High-throughput sequencing identified a tentative new virus in the family Geminiviridae infecting Calystegia sepium var. japonica in South Korea. The 2,706 nt long genome comprises six open reading frames (ORFs). The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the genome and the putative amino acid sequences of ORFs indicated that the virus was closely related to the members of the family Geminiviridae. The genome organization of the virus was similar to that of members of the genus Topilevirus in terms of the number of ORFs and splicing signal. However, the virus, tentatively named bindweed mottle virus (BWMV), may not be assigned to current genera into the family Geminiviridae.",

      "abstract": "The complete nucleotide sequence of a newly discovered virus infecting Quercus aliena Blume, tentatively named \"quercus leafroll virus\" (QLRV), was determined through high-throughput and Sanger sequencing. The sequence comprises 3,940 nucleotides, has five open reading frames, and has a typical pelarspovirus genome organization, with neither 3' polyadenylation nor a 5' cap. The proteins encoded by QLRV share 17.9 to 44.2% amino acid sequence identity with known pelarspovirus proteins. The highest amino acid sequence identity values for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein were 67.5% and 55.2%, respectively, which are below the current thresholds for pelarspovirus species demarcation. On the basis of these results, we propose classifying QLRV as a new member of the genus Pelarspovirus, family Tombusviridae.",

      "abstract": "A putative new polerovirus, named \"chrysanthemum virus D\" (ChVD), was detected in a Chrysanthemum morifolium plant in South Korea. The virus was identified by high-throughput sequencing and confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The entire ChVD genome is composed of 5,963 nucleotides and contains seven open reading frames (ORF0-5 and ORF3a), which are arranged similarly to those of other poleroviruses. These ORFs encode the putative proteins P0-5 and P3a, respectively. Pairwise amino acid sequence comparisons showed that the ChVD P0-5 and P3a proteins have 30.45-75% sequence identity to the corresponding proteins of other members of the genus Polerovirus. Since one of the species demarcation criteria for the genus Polerovirus is > 10% difference in the amino acid sequence of any gene product, the sequence comparisons indicate that ChVD represents a new species in this genus. Phylogenetic analysis of the P1-P2 and P3 amino acid sequences further indicate that ChVD is a novel polerovirus.",

Its monopartite genome consists of a single-stranded RNA of 15,024 nucleotides, and it shares 38.24 to 56.2% nucleotide sequence identity with known closterovirus genome sequences. Its genome contains nine hypothetical open reading frames. These encode the multifunctional protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), hydrophobic protein (P7), heat shock protein 70 homolog (HSP70h), coat protein homolog (CPh), minor coat protein (CPm), and major coat protein (CP), along with proteins involved in suppressing RNA silencing. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that, based on its HSP70h amino acid sequence, StAVC is closely related to members of the genus Closterovirus within the family Closteroviridae. This is the first record of the full genome sequence of StAVC in South Korea.",

      "abstract": "The genome of a new potyvirus from a Lamprocapnos spectabilis plant in South Korea was sequenced by high-throughput sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The new potyvirus was tentatively named \"lamprocapnos virus A\" (LaVA); its complete genome contains 9,745 nucleotides, excluding the 3'-terminal poly(A) tail. The LaVA genome structure is similar to that of members of the genus Potyvirus and contains an open reading frame encoding a large putative polyprotein of 3,120 amino acids (aa) with conserved motifs. The complete genome shared 48%-56% nucleotide sequence identity and the polyprotein shared 41%-52% aa sequence identity with those of other potyviruses. These values are below the standard thresholds for potyvirus species demarcation. Phylogenetic analysis based on polyprotein sequences showed that LaVA belongs to the genus Potyvirus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the complete genome sequence and genome characterization of a potyvirus infecting Lamprocapnos spectabilis.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic regulation of mitochondria shape via fission and fusion is critical for cellular responses to stimuli. In homeostatic cells, two modes of mitochondrial fission, midzone and peripheral, provide a decision fork between either proliferation or clearance of mitochondria. However, the relationship between specific mitochondria shapes and functions remains unclear in many biological contexts. While commonly associated with decreased bioenergetics, fragmented mitochondria paradoxically exhibit elevated respiration in several disease states, including infection with the prevalent pathogen human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and metastatic melanoma. Here, incorporating super-resolution microscopy with mass spectrometry and metabolic assays, we use HCMV infection to establish a molecular mechanism for maintaining respiration within a fragmented mitochondria population. We establish that HCMV induces fragmentation through peripheral mitochondrial fission coupled with suppression of mitochondria fusion. Unlike uninfected cells, the progeny of peripheral fission enter mitochondria-ER encapsulations (MENCs) where they are protected from degradation and bioenergetically stabilized during infection. MENCs also stabilize pro-viral inter-mitochondria contacts (IMCs), which electrochemically link mitochondria and promote respiration. Demonstrating a broader relevance, we show that the fragmented mitochondria within metastatic melanoma cells also form MENCs. Our findings establish a mechanism where mitochondria fragmentation can promote increased respiration, a feature relevant in the context of human diseases.",

      "abstract": "Herpesviruses remain a burden for animal and human health, including the medically important varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Membrane fusion mediated by conserved core glycoproteins, the fusogen gB and the heterodimer gH-gL, enables herpesvirus cell entry. The ectodomain of gB orthologs has five domains and is proposed to transition from a prefusion to postfusion conformation but the functional relevance of the domains for this transition remains poorly defined. Here we describe structure-function studies of the VZV gB DIII central helix targeting residues <sup>526</sup>EHV<sup>528</sup>. Critically, a H527P mutation captures gB in a prefusion conformation as determined by cryo-EM, a loss of membrane fusion in a virus free assay, and failure of recombinant VZV to spread in cell monolayers. Importantly, two predominant cryo-EM structures of gB[H527P] are identified by 3D classification and focused refinement, suggesting they represented gB conformations in transition. These studies reveal gB DIII as a critical element for herpesvirus gB fusion function.",

      "title": "Gal power: the diverse roles of galectins in regulating viral infections.",
      "abstract": "Viruses, as a class of pathogenic microbe, remain a significant health burden globally. Viral infections result in significant morbidity and mortality annually and many remain in need of novel vaccine and anti-viral strategies. The development of effective novel anti-viral therapeutics, in particular, requires detailed understanding of the mechanism of viral infection, and the host response, including the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. In recent years, the role of glycans and lectins in pathogen-host interactions has become an increasingly relevant issue. This review focuses on the interactions between a specific lectin family, galectins, and the broad range of viral infections in which they play a role. Discussed are the diverse activities that galectins play in interacting directly with virions or the cells they infect, to promote or inhibit viral infection. In addition we describe how galectin expression is regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by viral infections. We also compare the contribution of known galectin-mediated immune modulation, across a range of innate and adaptive immune anti-viral responses, to the outcome of viral infections.",

      "abstract": "Electron cryotomography (cryoET), an electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) modality, has changed our understanding of biological function by revealing the native molecular details of membranes, viruses, and cells. However, identification of individual molecules within tomograms from cryoET is challenging because of sample crowding and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we present a tagging strategy for cryoET that precisely identifies individual protein complexes in tomograms without relying on metal clusters. Our method makes use of DNA origami to produce \"molecular signposts\" that target molecules of interest, here via fluorescent fusion proteins, providing a platform generally applicable to biological surfaces. We demonstrate the specificity of signpost origami tags (SPOTs) in vitro as well as their suitability for cryoET of membrane vesicles, enveloped viruses, and the exterior of intact mammalian cells.",

      "abstract": "Viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites that reprogram host cells upon infection to produce viral progeny. Here, we review recent structural insights into virus-host interactions in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes unveiled by cellular electron cryo-tomography (cryoET). This advanced three-dimensional imaging technique of vitreous samples in near-native state has matured over the past two decades and proven powerful in revealing molecular mechanisms underlying viral replication. Initial studies were restricted to cell peripheries and typically focused on early infection steps, analyzing surface proteins and viral entry. Recent developments including cryo-thinning techniques, phase-plate imaging, and correlative approaches have been instrumental in also targeting rare events inside infected cells. When combined with advances in dedicated image analyses and processing methods, details of virus assembly and egress at (sub)nanometer resolution were uncovered. Altogether, we provide a historical and technical perspective and discuss future directions and impacts of cryoET for integrative structural cell biology analyses of viruses.",

      "title": "Development of learning objectives to support undergraduate virology curriculum guidelines.",
      "abstract": "It has become increasingly important for microbiology educators to help students learn critical concepts of the discipline. This is particularly true in virology, where current challenges include increasing rates of vaccine hesitancy, misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, and controversy surrounding research on pathogens with pandemic potential. Having students learn virology can attract more people to the field and increase the number of people who can engage in meaningful discourse about issues relating to the discipline. However, the limited number of virologists who teach undergraduates, combined with the fact that many institutions lack stand-alone virology courses, results in virology often being taught as a limited number of lectures within an undergraduate microbiology course (if it is covered at all), which may or may not be taught by an individual trained as a virologist. To provide a framework to teach virology to undergraduate students, a team of virology educators, with support from the American Society for Virology (ASV), developed curriculum guidelines for use in a stand-alone undergraduate virology course or a virology section within another course (D. B. Kushner et al., J Virol 96:e01305-22, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01305-22). These guidelines are available at the ASV website (https://asv.org/curriculum-guidelines/). To assist educators in implementing these guidelines, we created examples of measurable learning objectives. This perspective provides details about the virology curriculum guidelines and learning objectives and accompanies the perspective by Boury et al. in this issue of the <i>Journal of Microbiology & Biology Education</i> (25:e00126-24, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.00126-24) about the recent revision of the microbiology curriculum guidelines overseen by the American Society for Microbiology.",

      "title": "Epigenetic weapons in plant-herbivore interactions: Sulforaphane disrupts histone deacetylases, gene expression, and larval development in Spodoptera exigua while the specialist feeder Trichoplusia ni is largely resistant to these effects.",
      "abstract": "Cruciferous plants produce sulforaphane (SFN), an inhibitor of nuclear histone deacetylases (HDACs). In humans and other mammals, the consumption of SFN alters enzyme activities, DNA-histone binding, and gene expression within minutes. However, the ability of SFN to act as an HDAC inhibitor in nature, disrupting the epigenetic machinery of insects feeding on these plants, has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that SFN consumed in the diet inhibits the activity of HDAC enzymes and slows the development of the generalist grazer Spodoptera exigua, in a dose-dependent fashion. After consuming SFN for seven days, the activities of HDAC enzymes in S. exigua were reduced by 50%. Similarly, larval mass was reduced by 50% and pupation was delayed by 2-5 days, with no additional mortality. Similar results were obtained when SFN was applied topically to eggs. RNA-seq analyses confirm that SFN altered the expression of thousands of genes in S. exigua. Genes associated with energy conversion pathways were significantly downregulated while those encoding for ribosomal proteins were dramatically upregulated in response to the consumption of SFN. In contrast, the co-evolved specialist feeder Trichoplusia ni was not negatively impacted by SFN, whether it was consumed in their diet at natural concentrations or applied topically to eggs. The activities of HDAC enzymes were not inhibited and development was not disrupted. In fact, SFN exposure sometimes accelerated T. ni development. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the consumption of SFN alters gene expression in T. ni in similar ways, but to a lesser degree, compared to S. exigua. This apparent resistance of T. ni can be overwhelmed by unnaturally high levels of SFN or by exposure to more powerful pharmaceutical HDAC inhibitors. These results demonstrate that dietary SFN interferes with the epigenetic machinery of insects, supporting the hypothesis that plant-derived HDAC inhibitors serve as \"epigenetic weapons\" against herbivores.",

      "abstract": "Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) can reduce barriers to research opportunities while increasing student knowledge and confidence. However, the number of widely adopted, easily transferable CUREs is relatively small. Here, we describe a CURE aimed at determining the function of poorly characterized <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> genes. More than 20 years after sequencing of the yeast genome, nearly 10% of open reading frames (ORFs) still have at least one uncharacterized Gene Ontology (GO) term. We refer to these genes as \"ORFans\" and formed a consortium aimed at assigning functions to them. Specifically, over 70 faculty members attended summer workshops to learn the bioinformatics workflow and basic laboratory techniques described herein. Ultimately, this CURE was adapted for implementation at 34 institutions, resulting in over 1,300 students conducting course-based research on ORFans. Pre-/post-tests confirmed that students gained both (i) an understanding of gene ontology and (ii) knowledge regarding the use of bioinformatics to assign gene function. After using these data to craft their own hypotheses, then testing their predictions by constructing and phenotyping deletion strains, students self-reported significant gains in several areas, including computer modeling and exposure to a project where no one knows the outcome. Interestingly, most net gains self-reported by ORFan Gene Project participants were greater than published findings for CUREs assessed with the same survey instrument. The surprisingly strong impact of this CURE may be due to the incoming lack of experience of ORFan Project participants and/or the independent thought required to develop testable hypotheses from complex data sets.",

      "abstract": "Curricular guidelines promote standardized approaches to coverage of essential knowledge and skills in undergraduate education. The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology were developed in 2012. Continuous, rapid growth of knowledge in science and a dynamic, changing world necessitate updates to these guidelines. As such, ASM formed a task force in the summer of 2022. The task force assessed the 2012 ASM Curriculum Guidelines considering advancements in technology, an understanding of an expanded role of microbes, and a broader scope addressing relevant social and environmental aspects of microbiology. Language in the updated guidelines was also modified to better include eukaryotic microbes, viruses, and other acellular microbes. The task force formed working groups, each aimed at revising specific sections of the 2012 ASM Curriculum Guidelines. The revisions to the ASM Curriculum Guidelines were reviewed by subject matter experts and education stakeholders. Feedback from this peer review was incorporated into the updated guidelines, and further comments were solicited from the ASM Conference of Undergraduate Educators (ASMCUE) attendees in November 2023 before these guidelines were finalized. In this article, we describe the rationale and development of updated ASM Curriculum Guidelines which identify foundational concepts that will serve to improve microbial literacy and that can be expanded upon to address more advanced and specialized topics.",

      "abstract": "The pervasive effects of the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic are but one reason for educators to refocus their efforts on virology teaching. Additionally, it is critical to understand how viruses function and to elucidate the relationship between virus and host. An understanding of current virology education may improve pedagogical approaches for educating our students and trainees. Faculty who teach undergraduate microbiology indicate that approximately 10% of the course content features viruses; stand-alone virology courses are infrequently offered to undergraduates. Fortunately, virology taught to undergraduates includes foundational material; several approaches for delivery of lecture- and lab-based content exist. At the graduate education level, there is growing appreciation that an emphasis on logic, reasoning, inference, and statistics must be reintroduced into the curriculum to create a generation of scientists who have a greater capacity for creativity and innovation. Educators also need to remove barriers to student success, at all levels of education.",

      "title": "Molecular Research of Lipid Peroxidation and Antioxidant Enzyme Activity of <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> Bacterial Cells under the Hexachlorobenzene Impact.",
      "abstract": "The species of <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> is the most common human pathogen of the genus, which can be associated with acute appendicitis, infections of the bloodstream, the peritoneal cavity, cerebrospinal fluid, inflammatory bowel disease, and in general, bacteremia. According to the literature, <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> has destructive activity to a wide range of toxic chemical compounds, including chlorobenzenes. The specified strains were isolated from the soil of the organochlorine waste landfill, where hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was predominant. These strains were expected to be capable of degrading HCB. Microbiological (bacterial enrichment and cultivating, bacterial biomass obtaining), molecular biology, biochemical (enzymatic activities, malondialdehyde measuring, peroxidation lipid products measuring), and statistical methods were carried out in this research. The reaction of both strains (UCM B-400 and UCM B-401) to the hexachlorobenzene presence differed in the content of diene and triene conjugates and malondialdehyde, as well as different catalase and peroxidase activity levels. In terms of primary peroxidation products, diene conjugates were lower, except conditions with 20 mg/L HCB, where these were higher up to two times, than the pure control. Malondialdehyde in strain B-400 cells decreased up to five times, in B-401, but increased up to two times, compared to the pure control. Schiff bases in strain B-400 cells were 2-3 times lower than the pure control. However, in B-401 cells Schiff bases under higher HCB dose were in the same level with the pure control. Catalase activity was 1.5 times higher in all experimental variants, compared to the pure control (in the strain B-401 cells), but in the B-400 strain, cells were 2 times lower, compared to the pure control. The response of the two strains to hexachlorobenzene was similar only in peroxidase activity terms, which was slightly higher compared to the pure control. The physiological response of <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> strains to hexachlorobenzene has a typical strain reaction. The physiological response level of these strains to hexachlorobenzene confirms its tolerance, and indirectly, the ability to destroy the specified toxic compound.",

      "title": "Ancient viral genomes reveal introduction of human pathogenic viruses into Mexico during the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "abstract": "After the European colonization of the Americas, there was a dramatic population collapse of the Indigenous inhabitants caused in part by the introduction of new pathogens. Although there is much speculation on the etiology of the Colonial epidemics, direct evidence for the presence of specific viruses during the Colonial era is lacking. To uncover the diversity of viral pathogens during this period, we designed an enrichment assay targeting ancient DNA (aDNA) from viruses of clinical importance and applied it to DNA extracts from individuals found in a Colonial hospital and a Colonial chapel (16th-18th century) where records suggest that victims of epidemics were buried during important outbreaks in Mexico City. This allowed us to reconstruct three ancient human parvovirus B19 genomes and one ancient human hepatitis B virus genome from distinct individuals. The viral genomes are similar to African strains, consistent with the inferred morphological and genetic African ancestry of the hosts as well as with the isotopic analysis of the human remains, suggesting an origin on the African continent. This study provides direct molecular evidence of ancient viruses being transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and their subsequent introduction to New Spain. Altogether, our observations enrich the discussion about the etiology of infectious diseases during the Colonial period in Mexico.",

      "title": "Structures and Mechanisms of Nonsegmented, Negative-Strand RNA Virus Polymerases.",
      "abstract": "The nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs), also known as the order <i>Mononegavirales</i>, have a genome consisting of a single strand of negative-sense RNA. Integral to the nsNSV replication cycle is the viral polymerase, which is responsible for transcribing the viral genome, to produce an array of capped and polyadenylated messenger RNAs, and replicating it to produce new genomes. To perform the different steps that are necessary for these processes, the nsNSV polymerases undergo a series of coordinated conformational transitions. While much is still to be learned regarding the intersection of nsNSV polymerase dynamics, structure, and function, recently published polymerase structures, combined with a history of biochemical and molecular biology studies, have provided new insights into how nsNSV polymerases function as dynamic machines. In this review, we consider each of the steps involved in nsNSV transcription and replication and suggest how these relate to solved polymerase structures.",

      "abstract": "The transcription and replication processes of non-segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses (nsNSVs) are catalyzed by a multi-functional polymerase complex composed of the large protein (L) and a cofactor protein, such as phosphoprotein (P). Previous studies have shown that the nsNSV polymerase can adopt a dimeric form, however, the structure of the dimer and its function are poorly understood. Here we determine a 2.7 Å cryo-EM structure of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) L-P complex with the connector domain (CD') of a second L built, while reconstruction of the rest of the second L-P obtains a low-resolution map of the ring-like L core region. This study reveals detailed atomic features of nsNSV polymerase active site and distinct conformation of hPIV3 L with a unique β-strand latch. Furthermore, we report the structural basis of L-L dimerization, with CD' located at the putative template entry of the adjoining L. Disruption of the L-L interface causes a defect in RNA replication that can be overcome by complementation, demonstrating that L dimerization is necessary for hPIV3 genome replication. These findings provide further insight into how nsNSV polymerases perform their functions, and suggest a new avenue for rational drug design.",

      "abstract": "A growing number of studies indicate that mRNAs and long ncRNAs can affect protein populations by assembling dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. These phase-separated molecular 'sponges', stabilized by quinary (transient and weak) interactions, control proteins involved in numerous biological functions. Retroviruses such as HIV-1 form by self-assembly when their genomic RNA (gRNA) traps Gag and GagPol polyprotein precursors. Infectivity requires extracellular budding of the particle followed by maturation, an ordered processing of ∼2400 Gag and ∼120 GagPol by the viral protease (PR). This leads to a condensed gRNA-NCp7 nucleocapsid and a CAp24-self-assembled capsid surrounding the RNP. The choreography by which all of these components dynamically interact during virus maturation is one of the missing milestones to fully depict the HIV life cycle. Here, we describe how HIV-1 has evolved a dynamic RNP granule with successive weak-strong-moderate quinary NC-gRNA networks during the sequential processing of the GagNC domain. We also reveal two palindromic RNA-binding triads on NC, KxxFxxQ and QxxFxxK, that provide quinary NC-gRNA interactions. Consequently, the nucleocapsid complex appears properly aggregated for capsid reassembly and reverse transcription, mandatory processes for viral infectivity. We show that PR is sequestered within this RNP and drives its maturation/condensation within minutes, this process being most effective at the end of budding. We anticipate such findings will stimulate further investigations of quinary interactions and emergent mechanisms in crowded environments throughout the wide and growing array of RNP granules.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Presently, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the main cause of severe respiratory infections in infants, cannot be treated efficiently with antivirals. However, its RNA-dependent polymerase complex offers potential targets for RSV-specific drugs. This includes the recognition of its template, the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), consisting of genomic RNA encapsidated by the RSV nucleoprotein, N. This recognition proceeds via interaction between the phosphoprotein P, which is the main polymerase cofactor, and N. The determinant role of the C terminus of P, and more particularly of the last residue, F241, in RNP binding and viral RNA synthesis has been assessed previously. Here, we provide detailed structural insight into this crucial interaction for RSV polymerase activity. We solved the crystallographic structures of complexes between the N-terminal domain of N (N-NTD) and C-terminal peptides of P and characterized binding by biophysical approaches. Our results provide a rationale for the pivotal role of F241, which inserts into a well-defined N-NTD pocket. This primary binding site is completed by transient contacts with upstream P residues outside the pocket. Based on the structural information of the N-NTD:P complex, we identified inhibitors of this interaction, selected by in silico screening of small compounds, that efficiently bind to N and compete with P in vitro. One of the compounds displayed inhibitory activity on RSV replication, thereby strengthening the relevance of N-NTD for structure-based design of RSV-specific antivirals.<h4>Importance</h4>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a widespread pathogen that is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections in infants worldwide. RSV cannot be treated efficiently with antivirals, and no vaccine is presently available, with the development of pediatric vaccines being particularly challenging. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies that specifically target RSV. The interaction between the RSV phosphoprotein P and the ribonucleoprotein complex is critical for viral replication. In this study, we identified the main structural determinants of this interaction, and we used them to screen potential inhibitors in silico. We found a family of molecules that were efficient competitors of P in vitro and showed inhibitory activity on RSV replication in cellular assays. These compounds provide a basis for a pharmacophore model that must be improved but that holds promises for the design of new RSV-specific antivirals.",

      "abstract": "Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is frequently used for surveillance and diagnosis of arboviruses and emerging viruses. A disadvantage of RT-PCR assays, especially nested assays, is the potential for false-positive results caused by laboratory contamination from either positive controls or positive samples. Positive reactors usually require sequence determination for confirmation which delay timeous reporting of a result. Thus, the aim of the study was to use a simple technique to prepare a positive control allowing true positives to be differentiated from laboratory contamination based on size differentiation for conventional PCR, or melt temperatures for real time assays. A flavivirus positive control and an alphavirus positive control were prepared for two RT-PCR assays that we are currently using for arbovirus surveillance in South Africa. Primers targeting a region of the partial genes of interest cloned in pGEM®T-easy were modified at the 5' ends with non-viral nucleotides. The resulting amplicons were circularised, resulting in pGEM®T-easy constructs with 51 and 65 non-viral bases inserted into the partial flaviviral and alphaviral genes respectively and used as template for transcribing RNA. Sequence analysis was used to confirm the manipulation of the partial genes. Using virus specific primer pairs, viral RNA could be readily differentiated from the modified positive controls either by size differentiation, or melt temperature in a SYBR®Green real time RT-PCR. This study demonstrates how simple recombinant technology can be used to produce a positive control that has application in the laboratory for surveillance studies or as a diagnostic tool using synthetic genes to abrogate the requirement for handling infectious virus.",

      "abstract": "Influenza virus pandemics are caused by viruses from animal reservoirs that adapt to efficiently infect and replicate in human hosts. Here, we investigate whether Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 3 (IFITM3), a host antiviral factor with known human deficiencies, plays a role in interspecies virus infection and adaptation. We find that IFITM3-deficient mice and human cells can be infected with low doses of avian influenza viruses that fail to infect WT counterparts, identifying a new role for IFITM3 in controlling the minimum infectious virus dose threshold. Remarkably, influenza viruses passaged through Ifitm3<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit enhanced host adaptation, a result that is distinct from viruses passaged in mice deficient for interferon signaling, which exhibit attenuation. Our data demonstrate that IFITM3 deficiency uniquely facilitates potentially zoonotic influenza virus infections and subsequent adaptation, implicating IFITM3 deficiencies in the human population as a vulnerability for emergence of new pandemic viruses.",

      "abstract": "IL-35 is an immunosuppressive cytokine with roles in cancer, autoimmunity, and infectious disease. In the conventional model of IL-35 biology, the p35 and Ebi3 domains of this cytokine interact with IL-12Rβ2 and gp130, respectively, on the cell surface of regulatory T and regulatory B cells, triggering their suppression of Th cell activity. Here we use a human IL-12 bioactivity reporter cell line, protein binding assays, and primary human Th cells to demonstrate an additional mechanism by which IL-35 suppresses Th cell activity, wherein IL-35 directly inhibits the association of IL-12 with its surface receptor IL-12Rβ2 and downstream IL-12-dependent activities. IL-12 binding to the surface receptor IL-12Rβ1 was unaffected by IL-35. These data demonstrate that in addition to acting via regulatory T and regulatory B cells, human IL-35 can also directly suppress IL-12 bioactivity and its interaction with IL-12Rβ2.",

Activation of RLRs following RNA recognition leads to production of antiviral genes and IFNs for induction of broad antiviral immunity. Although the RLRs are ubiquitously expressed, much of our understanding of these molecules comes from their study in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. However, RLR activation is critical for induction of immune function and long-term protective immunity. Recent work has focused on the roles of RLRs in immune cells and their contribution to programming of effective immune responses. This new understanding of RLR function in immune cells and immune programming has led to the development of vaccines and therapeutics targeting the RLRs. This review covers recent advances in our understanding of the contribution of RLRs to immune cell function during infection and the emerging RLR-targeting strategies for induction of immunity against cancer and viral infection.",

      "abstract": "IFNs are comprised of three families of cytokines that confer protection against pathogen infection and uncontrolled cellular proliferation. The broad role IFNs play in innate and adaptive immune regulation has placed them under heavy scrutiny to position them as \"friend\" or \"foe\" across pathologies. Genetic lesions in genes involving IFN synthesis and signaling underscore the disparate outcomes of aberrant IFN signaling. Abrogation of the response leads to susceptibility to microbial infections whereas unabated IFN induction underlies a variety of inflammatory diseases and tumor immune evasion. Type I and III IFNs have overlapping roles in antiviral protection, yet the mechanisms by which they are induced and promote the expression of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammation can distinguish their biological functions. In this review, we examine the molecular factors that shape the shared and distinct roles of type I and III IFNs in immunity.",

The primary means of transmission of the virus in low- and middle-income countries is contaminated water, often due to a lack of access to proper sanitation, which leads to faecal contamination of water sources. Environmental surveillance is an important tool that can be used to monitor virus circulation and as an early warning system for outbreaks. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of HEV in wastewater, surface water (rivers and standpipe/ablution water), and effluent from a piggery in South Africa. A total of 536 water samples were screened for HEV using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 21.8% (117/536) of the wastewater, river, and ablution water samples tested positive for HEV, whereas 74.4% (29/39) of the samples from the piggery tested positive. Genotyping revealed sequences belonging to HEV genotypes 3 (98%, 53/54) and 4 (2%, 1/54), with subtypes 3c, 3f, and 4b being identified.",

      "abstract": "Herpesviruses are ancient large DNA viruses that have exploited gene capture as part of their strategy to escape immune surveillance, promote virus spreading, or reprogram host cells to benefit their survival. Most acquired genes are transmembrane proteins and cytokines, such as viral G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs), chemokines, and chemokine-binding proteins. This review focuses on the vGPCRs encoded by the human β- and γ-herpesviruses. These include receptors from human cytomegalovirus, which encodes four vGPCRs: US27, US28, UL33, and UL78; human herpesvirus 6 and 7 with two receptors: U12 and U51; Epstein-Barr virus with one: BILF1; and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus with one: open reading frame 74, ORF74. We discuss ligand binding, signaling, and structures of the vGPCRs in light of robust differences from endogenous receptors. Finally, we briefly discuss the therapeutic targeting of vGPCRs as future treatment of acute and chronic herpesvirus infections.",

      "abstract": "The γ-herpesvirus Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) establishes lifelong infections in approximately 90% of adults worldwide. Up to 1,000,000 people yearly are estimated to suffer from health conditions attributed to the infection with this virus, such as nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinomas as well as several forms of B, T and NK cell lymphoma. To date, no EBV-specific therapeutic option has reached the market, greatly reducing the survival prognoses of affected patients. Similar to other herpesviruses, EBV encodes for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), BILF1, affecting a multitude of cellular signaling pathways. BILF1 has been identified to promote immune evasion and tumorigenesis, effectively ensuring a life-long persistence of EBV in, and driving detrimental health conditions to its host. This review summarizes the epidemiology of EBV-associated malignancies, their current standard-of-care, EBV-specific therapeutics in development, GPCRs and their druggability, and most importantly consolidates the findings of over 15 years of research on BILF1 in the context of EBV-specific drug development. Taken together, BILF1 constitutes a promising target for the development of novel EBV-specific therapeutics.",

Neurotoxins are the main components of scorpion venom that are known to be responsible for the pathological manifestations of envenoming. Besides neurotoxins, a wide range of other bioactive molecules can be found in scorpion venoms. Advances in separation, characterization, and biotechnological approaches have enabled not only the development of more effective treatments against scorpion envenomings, but have also led to the discovery of several scorpion venom peptides with interesting therapeutic properties. Thus, scorpion venom may not only be a medical threat to human health, but could prove to be a valuable source of bioactive molecules that may serve as leads for the development of new therapies against current and emerging diseases. This review presents both the detrimental and beneficial properties of scorpion venom toxins and discusses the newest advances within the development of novel therapies against scorpion envenoming and the therapeutic perspectives for scorpion toxins in drug discovery.",

      "title": "Sporadic phage defense in epidemic &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt; mediated by the toxin-antitoxin system DarTG is countered by a phage-encoded antitoxin mimic.",
      "abstract": "Bacteria and their viral predators (phages) are constantly evolving to subvert one another. Many bacterial immune systems that inhibit phages are encoded on mobile genetic elements that can be horizontally transmitted to diverse bacteria. Despite the pervasive appearance of immune systems in bacteria, it is not often known if these immune systems function against phages that the host encounters in nature. Additionally, there are limited examples demonstrating how these phages counter-adapt to such immune systems. Here, we identify clinical isolates of the global pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> harboring a novel genetic element encoding the bacterial immune system DarTG and reveal the immune system's impact on the co-circulating lytic phage ICP1. We show that DarTG inhibits ICP1 genome replication, thus preventing ICP1 plaquing. We further characterize the conflict between DarTG-mediated defense and ICP1 by identifying an ICP1-encoded protein that counters DarTG and allows ICP1 progeny production. Finally, we identify this protein, AdfB, as a functional antitoxin that abrogates the toxin DarT likely through direct interactions. Following the detection of the DarTG system in clinical <i>V. cholerae</i> isolates, we observed a rise in ICP1 isolates with the functional antitoxin. These data highlight the use of surveillance of <i>V. cholerae</i> and its lytic phages to understand the co-evolutionary arms race between bacteria and their phages in nature.IMPORTANCEThe global bacterial pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> causes an estimated 1 to 4 million cases of cholera each year. Thus, studying the factors that influence its persistence as a pathogen is of great importance. One such influence is the lytic phage ICP1, as once infected by ICP1, <i>V. cholerae</i> is destroyed. To date, we have observed that the phage ICP1 shapes <i>V. cholerae</i> evolution through the flux of anti-phage bacterial immune systems. Here, we probe clinical <i>V. cholerae</i> isolates for novel anti-phage immune systems that can inhibit ICP1 and discover the toxin-antitoxin system DarTG as a potent inhibitor. Our results underscore the importance of <i>V. cholerae</i> and ICP1 surveillance to elaborate novel means by which <i>V. cholerae</i> can persist in both the human host and aquatic reservoir in the face of ICP1.",

      "abstract": "Bacteriophages or phages-viruses of bacteria-are abundant and considered to be highly diverse. Interestingly, a particular group of lytic <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>-specific phages (vibriophages) of the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh cholera phage 1 (ICP1) lineage show high levels of genome conservation over large spans of time and geography, despite a constant coevolutionary arms race with their host. From a collection of 67 sequenced ICP1 isolates, mostly from clinical samples, we find these phages have mosaic genomes consisting of large, conserved modules disrupted by variable sequences that likely evolve mostly through mobile endonuclease-mediated recombination during coinfection. Several variable regions have been associated with adaptations against antiphage elements in <i>V. cholerae</i>; notably, this includes ICP1's CRISPR-Cas system. The ongoing association of ICP1 and <i>V. cholerae</i> in cholera-endemic regions makes this system a rich source for discovery of novel defense and counterdefense strategies in bacteria-phage conflicts in nature.",

We used an <i>in vitro</i> blood-brain barrier (BBB) model made up of human brain-like endothelial cells (hBLECs) and brain pericytes grown in transwell systems to investigate whether three genetically distinct EV-A71 strains (subgenogroups C1, C1-like, and C4) can cross the human BBB. EV-A71 poorly replicated in hBLECs, which released moderate amounts of infectious viruses from their luminal side and trace amounts of infectious viruses from their basolateral side. The barrier properties of hBLECs were not impaired by EV-A71 infection. We investigated the passage through hBLECs of EV-A71-infected white blood cells. EV-A71 strains efficiently replicated in immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, and NK/T cells. Attachment to hBLECs of immune cells infected with the C1-like virus was higher than attachment of cells infected with C1-06. EV-A71 infection did not impair the transmigration of immune cells through hBLECs. Overall, EV-A71 targets different white blood cell populations that have the potential to be used as a Trojan horse to cross hBLECs more efficiently than cell-free EV-A71 particles.IMPORTANCEEnterovirus A71 (EV-A71) was first reported in the USA, and numerous outbreaks have since occurred in Asia and Europe. EV-A71 re-emerged as a new multirecombinant strain in 2015 in Europe and is now widespread. The virus causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease in young children and is involved in nervous system infections. How the virus spreads to the nervous system is unclear. We investigated whether white blood cells could be infected by EV-A71 and transmit it across human endothelial cells mimicking the blood-brain barrier protecting the brain from adverse effects. We found that endothelial cells provide a strong roadblock to prevent the passage of free virus particles but allow the migration of infected immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, and NK/T cells. Our data are consistent with the potential role of immune cells in the pathogenesis of EV-A71 infections by spreading the virus in the blood and across the human blood-brain barrier.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The emergence of new strains in RNA viruses is mainly due to mutations or intra and inter-genotype homologous recombination. Non-homologous recombinations may be deleterious and are rarely detected. In previous studies, we identified HCV-1b strains bearing two tandemly repeated V3 regions in the NS5A gene without ORF disruption. This polymorphism may be associated with an unfavorable course of liver disease and possibly involved in liver carcinogenesis. Here we aimed at characterizing the origin of these mutant strains and identifying the evolutionary mechanism on which the V3 duplication relies.<h4>Methods</h4>Direct sequencing of the entire NS5A and E1 genes was performed on 27 mutant strains. Quasispecies analyses in consecutive samples were also performed by cloning and sequencing the NS5A gene for all mutant and wild strains. We analyzed the mutant and wild-type sequence polymorphisms using Bayesian methods to infer the evolutionary history of and the molecular mechanism leading to the duplication-like event.<h4>Results</h4>Quasispecies were entirely composed of exclusively mutant or wild-type strains respectively. Mutant quasispecies were found to have been present since contamination and had persisted for at least 10 years. This V3 duplication-like event appears to have resulted from non-homologous recombination between HCV-1b wild-type strains around 100 years ago. The association between increased liver disease severity and these HCV-1b mutants may explain their persistence in chronically infected patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results emphasize the possible consequences of non-homologous recombination in the emergence and severity of new viral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) package a single-stranded (ss) DNA genome of 4.7 kb in their capsid of ~20 nm in diameter. AAV replication requires co-infection of a helper virus, such as adenovirus. During the optimization of recombinant AAV production, a small viral nonstructural protein, membrane-associated accessory protein (MAAP), was identified. However, the function of the MAAP in the context of AAV infection remains unknown. Here, we investigated the expression strategy and function of the MAAP during infection of both AAV2 and AAV5 in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells. We found that AAV2 MAAP2 and AAV5 MAAP5 are expressed from the capsid gene (<i>cap</i>)-transcribing mRNA spliced from the donor to the second splice site that encodes VP2 and VP3. Thus, this AAV <i>cap</i> gene transcribes a multicistronic mRNA that can be translated to four viral proteins, MAAP, VP2, AAP, and VP3 in order. In AAV2 infection, MAAP2 predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, alongside the capsid, near the nuclear and plasma membranes, but a fraction of MAAP2 exhibited nuclear localization. In AAV5 infection, MAAP5 revealed a distinct pattern, predominantly localizing within the nucleus. In the cells infected with an MAAP knockout mutant of AAV2 or AAV5, both viral DNA replication and virus replication increased, whereas virus egress decreased, and the decrease in virus egress can be restored by providing MAAP <i>in trans</i>. In summary, MAAP, a novel AAV nonstructural protein translated from a multicistronic viral <i>cap</i> mRNA, not only facilitates cellular egress of AAV but also likely negatively affects viral DNA replication during infection.<h4>Importance</h4>Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been used as a gene delivery vector in clinical gene therapy. In current gene therapies employing rAAV, a high dose of the vector is required. Consequently, there is a high demand for efficient and high-purity vector production systems. In this study, we demonstrated that membrane-associated accessory protein (MAAP), a small viral nonstructural protein, is translated from the same viral mRNA transcript encoding VP2 and VP3. In AAV-infected cells, apart from its prevalent expression in the cytoplasm with localization near the plasma and nuclear membranes, the MAAP also exhibits notable localization within the nucleus. During AAV infection, MAAP expression increases the cellular egress of progeny virions and decreases viral DNA replication and progeny virion production. Thus, the choice of MAAP expression has pros and cons during AAV infection, which could provide a guide to rAAV production.",

      "abstract": "Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a human parvovirus that causes lower respiratory tract infections in young children. It contains a single-stranded (ss) DNA genome of ~5.5 kb that encodes a small noncoding RNA of 140 nucleotides known as bocavirus-encoded small RNA (BocaSR), in addition to viral proteins. Here, we determined the secondary structure of BocaSR in vivo by using DMS-MaPseq. Our findings reveal that BocaSR undergoes N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification at multiple sites, which is critical for viral DNA replication in both dividing HEK293 cells and nondividing cells of the human airway epithelium. Mechanistically, we found that m6A-modified BocaSR serves as a mediator for recruiting Y-family DNA repair DNA polymerase (Pol) η and Pol κ likely through a direct interaction between BocaSR and the viral DNA replication origin at the right terminus of the viral genome. Thus, this report represents direct involvement of a viral small noncoding RNA in viral DNA replication through m6A modification.",

      "title": "High-Throughput Screening Identifies Inhibitors for Parvovirus B19 Infection of Human Erythroid Progenitors.",
      "abstract": "Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection can cause hematological disorders and fetal hydrops during pregnancy. Currently, no antivirals or vaccines are available for the treatment or prevention of B19V infection. To identify novel small-molecule antivirals against B19V replication, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, which is based on an <i>in vitro</i> nicking assay using recombinant N-terminal amino acids 1 to 176 of the viral large nonstructural protein (NS1N) and a fluorescently labeled DNA probe (<i>OriQ</i>) that spans the nicking site of the viral DNA replication origin. We collectively screened 17,040 compounds and identified 2,178 (12.78%) hits that possess >10% inhibition of the NS1 nicking activity, among which 84 hits were confirmed to inhibit nicking in a dose-dependent manner. Using <i>ex vivo</i>-expanded primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) infected by B19V, we validated 24 compounds that demonstrated >50% <i>in vivo</i> inhibition of B19V infection at 10 μM, which can be categorized into 7 structure scaffolds. Based on the therapeutic index (half-maximal cytotoxic concentration [CC<sub>50</sub>]/half-maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>] ratio) in EPCs, the top 4 compounds were chosen to examine their inhibitions of B19V infection in EPCs at two times of the 90% maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>90</sub>). A purine derivative (P7) demonstrated an antiviral effect (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.46 μM) without prominent cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> = 71.8 μM) in EPCs and exhibited 92% inhibition of B19V infection in EPCs at 3.32 μM, which can be used as the lead compound in future studies for the treatment of B19V infection-caused hematological disorders. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> B19V encodes a large nonstructural protein, NS1. Its N-terminal domain (NS1N) consisting of amino acids 1 to 176 binds to viral DNA and serves as an endonuclease to nick the viral DNA replication origins, which is a pivotal step in rolling-hairpin-dependent B19V DNA replication. For high-throughput screening (HTS) of anti-B19V antivirals, we miniaturized a fluorescence-based <i>in vitro</i> nicking assay, which employs a fluorophore-labeled probe spanning the terminal resolution site (<i>trs</i>) and the NS1N protein, into a 384-well-plate format. The HTS assay showed high reliability and capability in screening 17,040 compounds. Based on the therapeutic index (half-maximal cytotoxic concentration [CC<sub>50</sub>]/half-maximal effective concentration [EC<sub>50</sub>] ratio) in EPCs, a purine derivative demonstrated an antiviral effect of 92% inhibition of B19V infection in EPCs at 3.32 μM (two times the EC<sub>90</sub>). Our study demonstrated a robust HTS assay for screening antivirals against B19V infection.",

      "abstract": "Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection causes diseases in humans ranging from the mild <i>erythema infectiosum</i> to severe hematological disorders. The unique region of the minor structural protein VP1 (VP1u) of 227 amino acids harbors strong neutralizing epitopes which elicit dominant immune responses in patients. Recent studies have shown that the VP1u selectively binds to and enters B19V permissive cells through an unknown cellular proteinaceous receptor. In the present study, we demonstrated that purified recombinant VP1u effectively inhibits B19V infection of <i>ex vivo</i> expanded primary human erythroid progenitors. Furthermore, we identified the amino acid sequence 5-68 of the VP1 (VP1u<sup>5-68aa</sup>) is sufficient to confer the inhibition of B19V infection at a level similar to that of the full-length VP1u. <i>In silico</i> structure prediction suggests that the VP1u<sup>5-68aa</sup> contains three α-helices. Importantly, we found that the inhibition capability of the minimal domain VP1u<sup>5-68aa</sup> is independent of its dimerization but is likely dependent on the structure of the three predicated α-helices. As VP1u<sup>5-68aa</sup> outcompetes the full-length VP1u in entering cells, we believe that VP1u<sup>5-68aa</sup> functions as a receptor-binding ligand during virus entry. Finally, we determined the effective inhibition potency of VP1u<sup>5-68aa</sup> in B19V infection of human erythroid progenitors, which has a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 67 nM, suggesting an anti-viral peptide candidate to combat B19V infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>Human parvovirus B19 infection causes severe hematological disorders, including transient aplastic crisis, pure red cell aplasia, and hydrops fetalis. A productive B19 infection is highly restricted to human erythroid progenitors in human bone marrow and fetal liver. In the current study, we identified that the N-terminal 5-68 amino acids domain of the minor viral capsid protein VP1 enters <i>ex vivo</i> expanded human erythroid progenitors, which is nearly 5 times more efficient than the full-length VP1 unique region (1-227aa). Importantly, purified recombinant 5-68aa of the VP1 has a high efficiency in inhibition of parvovirus B19 infection of human erythroid progenitors, which has a half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 67 nM and a low cytotoxicity. The N-terminal 5-68 amino acids holds the potential as an effective antiviral of parvovirus B19 caused hematological disorders, as well as a carrier to deliver proteins to human erythroid progenitors.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Importance</h4>The essential steps of successful gene delivery by recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) include vector internalization, intracellular trafficking, nuclear import, uncoating, double-stranded (ds)DNA conversion, and transgene expression. rAAV2.5T has a chimeric capsid of AAV2 VP1u and AAV5 VP2 and VP3 with the mutation A581T. Our investigation revealed that KIAA0319L, the multiple AAV serotype receptor, is not essential for vector internalization but remains critical for efficient vector transduction to human airway epithelia. Additionally, we identified that a novel gene <i>WDR63</i>, whose cellular function is not well understood, plays an important role in vector transduction of human airway epithelia but not vector internalization and nuclear entry. Our study also discovered the substantial transduction potential of rAAV2.5T in basal stem cells of human airway epithelia, underscoring its utility in gene editing of human airways. Thus, the knowledge derived from this study holds promise for the advancement of gene therapy in the treatment of pulmonary genetic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Vector-borne diseases are responsible for more than 20% of the infectious diseases worldwide. The prevalence of arboviruses transmit diseases to humans in Sudan has not been investigated. Mosquito-borne viral diseases increase globally incidence, including the Sudan. Frequent unknown fever outbreaks have been reported in eastern region, Sudan. However, diagnosis was based exclusively on clinical signs and symptoms without confirmatory laboratory investigations. However, for accurate detection of these viruses in outbreaks, molecular technique is considered. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of six arboviruses in the Kassala state of east Sudan during unknown fever outbreak. A cross sectional hospital-based study was conducted in the Kassala, Teaching Hospital. Blood samples from 119 patients suffering from unknown fever were used for screening of six arboviruses, hepatitis E virus and malarial using molecular techniques and serology.  The overall arboviruses seroprevelance was 61.3% (73/119). The highest positivity rate was 73.1% (52/73) chikungunya virus; 29 males and 20 females patients were chikungunya positive. Other arboviruses were circulating in low rate 20.5% (15/73), and 6.8% (5/73) for sindbis and rift valley fever viruses respectively. Hepatitis E virus was negative in all cases and malaria positivity rate 13.4% (16/119). The prevalence of arboviruses among unknown fever patients present to Kassala teaching hospital of eastern region in Sudan is significantly high (61.3%). The chikungunya virus is the predominant causative agent of arboviruses. Molecular techniques such as PCR are important for accurate and rapid diagnosis of this viral outbreak.",

      "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly spread globally. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a reported fatality rate ranging from 1% to 7%, and people with immune-compromised conditions, children, and older adults are particularly vulnerable. Respiratory failure and cytokine storm-induced multiple organ failure are the major causes of death. This article highlights the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms of host cells activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible therapeutic approaches against COVID-19. Some potential drugs proven to be effective for other viral diseases are under clinical trials now for use against COVID-19. Examples include inhibitors of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin), viral protein synthesis (ivermectin, lopinavir/ ritonavir), and fusion of the viral membrane with host cells (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, and umifenovir). This article also presents the intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials, explaining potential candidates (live attenuated-whole virus vaccines, inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNAbased vaccines, protein-based vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccines, virus-like particles and mRNA-based vaccines). Designing and developing an effective vaccine (both prophylactic and therapeutic) would be a long-term solution and the most effective way to eliminate the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>The development of oral and oropharyngeal cancers is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, debate exists about the prevalence of high-risk oral HPV (HR-HPV) and its associated risk factors. This study evaluated the distribution of genotypes and associated risk factors of oral HR-HPV infection in the normal oral mucosa of the Pakistani female population with general gynecological problems.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 200 females from a regional gynecological hospital in Pakistan were included in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire was carried out, followed by the study participants' oral and dental examinations. Whole saliva was collected by a drooling method. The viral DNA extraction and oral HR-HPV genotyping were detected via real-time polymerase chain reaction.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 200 females (mean age, 37.76 years), 22 females (11%) were positive for oral HR-HPV DNA. Single oral HR-HPV infection was seen in 8%, whereas co-infection was observed in 3% with HPV16 and HPV18 most common genotypes. Comparison of the risk factors like oral sex history odds ratio (OR 8.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85-28.16; p < 0.005), and open-mouth kissing (OR, 5.17; 95% CI 1.48-27.41; p = 0.005) with oral HR-HPV infection was found to be significantly associated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In Pakistan, oral HR-HPV-positive infection is not uncommon; HPV16 and HPV18 are the most frequent genotypes. Furthermore, this study also provides data that oral HR-HPV positive infection was significantly associated with sexual behaviors. Therefore, preventive health efforts, like health education and vaccination, should be practiced.",

      "abstract": "The recent development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs has revolutionized the area of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapeutics but the efficacy and clinical outcome of interferon (IFN)-free therapy have not been extensively studied yet. We observed a dramatic increase in hypothyroidism among patients treated with sofosbuvir, IFN, and ribavirin. This is the first prospective study of the thyroid dysfunction in DAA drugs treated patients. This study compared the risk of hypothyroidism in two different groups of HCV patients treated with different DAA drugs regimens that were sofosbuvir + pegylated-IFN-α + ribavirin and sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + ribavirin. Our findings highlight the periodic screening of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and T4 levels in HCV infected patients during the treatment and posttreatment.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid dysfunctions occur frequently among hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. Accumulating evidence has shown the higher incidence of thyroid dysfunctions in interferon-treated patients that was previously the standard of care therapy. However, the prevalence of thyroid disorders has not been studied in the recently developed interferon-free regimens or direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs-treated patients. We recruited 37 patients who had just completed 6 months long sofosbuvir-based treatment, and 26 interferon-treated patients were also included in the study. Serum thyrotropin level of all participants was measured using VIDAS. We observed thyroid dysfunctions in both pegylated interferon-experienced and DAA drug-experienced patients but the prevalence of hyperthyroidism was found significantly higher in patients treated with interferon-based regimen as compared with interferon-free regimens. This high prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with HCV posttreatment highlights the need for regular periodic screening of patients during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "Mosquito-borne flaviviruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) represent a public health problem in some parts of the world. Although ZIKV infection is predominantly asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms, it can lead to neurological complications. ZIKV infection can also cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection with similar viruses, warranting further studies of virion assembly and the function of envelope (E) protein-specific antibodies. Although extracellular vesicles (EVs) from flavivirus-infected cells have been reported to transmit infection, this interpretation is challenged by difficulties in separating EVs from flavivirions due to their similar biochemical composition and biophysical properties. In the present study, a rigorous EV-virion separation method combining sequential ultracentrifugation and affinity capture was developed to study EVs from ZIKV-infected cells. We find that these EVs do not transmit infection, but EVs display abundant E proteins which have an antigenic landscape similar to that of virions carrying E. ZIKV E-coated EVs attenuate antibody-dependent enhancement mediated by ZIKV E-specific and DENV-cross-reactive antibodies in both cell culture and mouse models. We thus report an alternative route for Flavivirus E protein secretion. These results suggest that modulation of E protein release via virions and EVs may present a new approach to regulating flavivirus-host interactions.",

      "abstract": "Mycoviruses are widely distributed across the kingdom Fungi, including ascomycetous yeast strains of the class Saccharomycetes. Geotrichum candidum is an important fungal pathogen belonging to Saccharomycetes and has a diverse host range. Here, we report the characterization of four new classical totiviruses from two distinct Geotrichum candidum strains from Pakistan. The four identified viruses were tentatively named \"Geotrichum candidum totivirus 1, 2, 3a, and 3b\" (GcTV1-3b). The complete dsRNA genomes of the identified totiviruses are 4621, 4592, 4576, and 4576 bp in length, respectively. All totivirus genomes have two open reading frames, encoding a capsid protein (CP) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), respectively. The downstream RdRP domain is assumed to be expressed as a CP-RdRP fusion product via -1 frameshifting mediated by a heptameric slippery site. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis showed that each of the discovered viruses belongs to a new species of the genus Totivirus in the family Totiviridae, with GcTV1 and GcTV3 (a and b strains) clustering in one subgroup and GcTV2 in another subgroup.",

Complete sequencing of the four genomic dsRNA segments revealed molecular features similar to but distinct from previously reported members of the family Chrysoviridae. Unique features include the presence of a mini-cistron preceding the major large open reading frame in each genomic segment. Common features include the presence of CAA repeats in the 5'-untranslated regions and conserved terminal sequences. CnCV1-OB5/11 could be laterally transferred to C. nitschkei and its relatives C. radicalis and C. naterciae via coculturing, virion transfection and protoplast fusion, but not to fungal species other than the three species mentioned above, even within the genus Cryphonectria, suggesting a very narrow host range. Phenotypic comparison of a few sets of CnCV1-infected and -free isogenic strains showed symptomless infection in new hosts.",

      "abstract": "The family Partitiviridae has five genera, among which is the genus Deltapartitivirus. We report here the complete genome sequence of a deltapartitivirus from red clover, termed \"red clover cryptic virus 3\" (RCCV3). RCCV3 has a bisegmented double-stranded (ds) RNA genome. dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 are 1580 and 1589 nucleotides (nt) in length and are predicted to encode an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRP) and a capsid protein (CP), respectively. The RCCV3 RdRP shares the highest sequence identity with the RdRP of a previously reported deltapartitivirus, Medicago sativa deltapartitivirus 1 (MsDPV1) (76.5%), while the RCCV3 CP shows 50% sequence identity to the CP of MsDPV1. RdRP- and CP-based phylogenetic trees place RCCV3 into a clade of deltapartitiviruses. The sequence and phylogenetic analyses clearly indicate that RCCV3 represents a new species in the genus Deltapartitivirus. RCCV3 was detectable in all three tested cultivars of red clover.",

      "abstract": "The ascomycete <i>Cryphonectria parasitica</i> causes destructive chestnut blight. Biological control of the fungus by virus infection (hypovirulence) has been shown to be an effective control strategy against chestnut blight in Europe. To provide biocontrol effects, viruses must be able to induce hypovirulence and spread efficiently in chestnut trees. Field studies using living trees to date have focused on a selected family of viruses called hypoviruses, especially prototypic hypovirus CHV1, but there are now known to be many other viruses that infect <i>C. parasitica</i> Here, we tested seven different viruses for their hypovirulence induction, biocontrol potential, and transmission properties between two vegetatively compatible but molecularly distinguishable fungal strains in trees. The test included cytosolically and mitochondrially replicating viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA or double-stranded RNA genomes. The seven viruses showed different <i>in planta</i> behaviors and were classified into four groups. Group I, including CHV1, had great biocontrol potential and could protect trees by efficiently spreading and converting virulent to hypovirulent cankers in the trees. Group II could induce high levels of hypovirulence but showed much smaller biocontrol potential, likely because of inefficient virus transmission. Group III showed poor performance in hypovirulence induction and biocontrol, while efficiently being transmitted in the infected trees. Group IV could induce hypovirulence and spread efficiently but showed poor biocontrol potential. Nuclear and mitochondrial genotyping of fungal isolates obtained from the treated cankers confirmed virus transmission between the two fungal strains in most isolates. These results are discussed in view of dynamic interactions in the tripartite pathosystem.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The ascomycete <i>Cryphonectria parasitica</i> causes destructive chestnut blight, which is controllable by hypovirulence-conferring viruses infecting the fungus. The tripartite chestnut/<i>C. parasitica</i>/virus pathosystem involves the dynamic interactions of their genetic elements, i.e., virus transmission and lateral transfer of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes between fungal strains via anastomosis occurring in trees. Here, we tested diverse RNA viruses for their hypovirulence induction, biocontrol potential, and transmission properties between two vegetatively compatible but molecularly distinguishable fungal strains in live chestnut trees. The tested viruses, which are different in genome type (single-stranded or double-stranded RNA) and organization, replication site (cytosol or mitochondria), virus form (encapsidated or capsidless) and/or symptomatology, have been unexplored in the aforementioned aspects under controlled conditions. This study showed intriguing different in-tree behaviors of the seven viruses and suggested that to exert significant biocontrol effects, viruses must be able to induce hypovirulence and spread efficiently in the fungus infecting the chestnut trees.",

      "abstract": "Positive-sense (+), single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses with divided RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domains have been reported from diverse filamentous ascomycetes since 2020. These viruses are termed splipalmiviruses or polynarnaviruses and have been characterized largely at the sequence level, but ill-defined biologically. Cryphonectria naterciae, from which only one virus has been reported, is an ascomycetous fungus potentially plant-pathogenic to chestnut and oak trees. We molecularly characterized multiple viruses in a single Portuguese isolate (C0614) of C. naterciae, taking a metatranscriptomic and conventional double-stranded RNA approach. Among them are a novel splipalmivirus (Cryphonectria naterciae splipalmivirus 1, CnSpV1) and a novel fusagravirus (Cryphonectria naterciae fusagravirus 1, CnFGV1). This study focused on the former virus. CnSpV1 has a tetra-segmented, (+)ssRNA genome (RNA1 to RNA4). As observed for other splipalmiviruses reported in 2020 and 2021, the RdRP domain is separately encoded by RNA1 (motifs F, A and B) and RNA2 (motifs C and D). A hypothetical protein encoded by the 5'-proximal open reading frame of RNA3 shows similarity to a counterpart conserved in some splipalmiviruses. The other RNA3-encoded protein and RNA4-encoded protein show no similarity with known proteins in a blastp search. The tetra-segment nature was confirmed by the conserved terminal sequences of the four CnSpV1 segments (RNA1 to RNA4) and their 100% coexistence in over 100 single conidial isolates tested. The experimental introduction of CnSpV1 along with CnFGV1 into a virus free strain C0754 of C. naterciae vegetatively incompatible with C0614 resulted in no phenotypic alteration, suggesting asymptomatic infection. The protoplast fusion assay indicates a considerably narrow host range of CnSpV1, restricted to the species C. naterciae and C. carpinicola. This study contributes to better understanding of the molecular and biological properties of this unique group of viruses.",
